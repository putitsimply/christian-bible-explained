# System Patterns

Content patterns:

- One Markdown file per Bible book, titled with a single `#` heading.
- Overview pages for testaments (Old/New) include GitBook frontmatter for layout options.
- Pages aim for short sections with simple headings and occasional bullet lists.
- When using GitBook footnote annotations, keep a blank line between each `[^...]:` definition line for reliable parsing.

Navigation patterns:

- `SUMMARY.md` controls GitBook navigation.
- Books should be grouped into meaningful sections (Old/New testament, then smaller genre/collection groupings).
