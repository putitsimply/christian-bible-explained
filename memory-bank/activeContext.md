# Active Context

Current focus:

- Review content for correctness and internal consistency.
- Ensure the New Testament overview page actually describes the New Testament (it previously duplicated the Old Testament overview).
- Enforce the 500-word limit (e.g., trim pages that run long).
- Improve navigation structure in `SUMMARY.md` by grouping books rather than listing them flat.

Decisions:

- Prefer descriptive, neutral phrasing (“the book describes…”, “the text says…”, “Christians believe…”) especially for miraculous claims.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing tone.

Recent changes:

- Added a neutral home page (`README.md`) and split testament overviews into `old-testament.md` and `new-testament.md`.
- Reworked `SUMMARY.md` into grouped sections (Law/History/Wisdom/Prophets; Gospels/Letters/etc.).
- Trimmed `philippians.md` to meet the 500-word target and adjusted phrasing in a few New Testament pages for a more neutral tone.
