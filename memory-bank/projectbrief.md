# Project Brief

This repository is a GitBook that gives short, neutral summaries of each book of the Christian Bible for an Australian upper-primary audience (around age 12).

Goals:

- Keep explanations clear, age-appropriate, and religiously impartial.
- Avoid religious jargon; when jargon is needed, define it.
- Keep each page to 500 words or fewer.
- Provide a consistent structure across pages so students can compare books easily.

Scope:

- Summaries for the 66-book Protestant ordering (as reflected in `SUMMARY.md`).
- Overview pages for the Old Testament and New Testament.
- Navigation that is easy to browse by section and genre.
