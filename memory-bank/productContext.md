# Product Context

Why this exists:

- Many students encounter Bible stories in literature, history, art, or religious education, but may not know how the Bible is organised.
- A short, neutral guide helps students understand what each book is “about” without assuming personal belief.

How it should work:

- Each page explains what the book contains (genre), the main ideas, and the major storyline (if any).
- Language stays descriptive (e.g., “the text describes…”, “Christians believe…”) rather than preachy or argumentative.
- The table of contents groups books into familiar sections (e.g., Law/History/Wisdom/Prophets; Gospels/Letters).

User experience goals:

- Students can quickly find a book and get a readable overview in a few minutes.
- Teachers can rely on consistent phrasing, definitions, and length limits.
- The 500-word limit is for content pages (book summaries and overviews), not for reference/navigation pages like the glossary.
