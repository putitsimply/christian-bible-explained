# Progress

What works:

- Most individual book pages are already short and age-appropriate.
- `SUMMARY.md` lists all books in order.

Known issues:

- The New Testament overview page content was incorrect (duplicated Old Testament overview).
- Navigation is a long flat list, which is harder to browse for students.
- At least one page exceeded the 500-word target.

Next steps:

- Spot-check remaining book pages for any factual slips or overly “certain” wording.
- Optionally add a small glossary page for recurring terms (covenant, prophet, gospel, Messiah, disciple, etc.).
