# 1 John

## What this book is

**1 John** is a short letter in the New Testament. It was written to help a group of early Christians stay confident in their faith and spot teachings that were misleading.

## What it contains

### 1) The big message: God is light, so live in the light

The letter says that **God is “light”**, which is a picture word meaning God is good, truthful, and not evil. The writer tells the readers to “walk in the light”, meaning to live honestly and do what is right.

It also explains that people still do wrong things, even if they believe in God. But the letter says they should **admit their sins** (sins are wrong actions and choices) and trust that God forgives them. Christians believe Jesus helps repair the relationship between people and God.

### 2) How to tell what is true: belief and behaviour

A major problem in the background is that some teachers were saying things about Jesus that the writer strongly disagreed with, especially the idea that Jesus was not truly human. The writer insists that Jesus was real and physical, not just a spiritual idea.

The letter gives “tests” for recognising real faith:

* **Right belief**: trusting that Jesus is the Christ (God’s chosen king) and truly came as a human.
* **Right living**: trying to obey God’s commands, especially loving others.
* **Right love**: caring for people in practical ways, not just with words.

The writer says that people who claim to know God but live in a cruel, dishonest, or selfish way are not being consistent.

### 3) Love is the centre

Over and over, 1 John returns to one main command: **love one another**. The writer says this is not a new idea, but it is the clearest sign of genuine faith.

A famous line from the letter is **“God is love.”** It teaches that God’s love is shown through Jesus, and that people should copy that love by caring for others. It says love is meant to push out fear, especially fear about judgement.

### 4) Confidence and warning

The writer wants readers to feel **assurance**, meaning they can have confidence that they belong to God. But there is also a warning: do not be pulled away by teachers who deny Jesus or encourage unloving behaviour. The letter calls those kinds of influences “antichrist”, meaning people or ideas that oppose Christ.

### 5) How it ends

1 John finishes by saying the letter was written so believers can **know** they have “eternal life” (life with God that lasts). It also gives a final practical warning: **stay away from idols**, meaning anything that replaces God as the most important thing in your life.

## Big ideas

* Belief and behaviour are linked: what you say you believe should match how you live.
* Love is treated as the clearest sign of real faith.
* The letter aims to give confidence while warning against misleading teaching.
