# 1 John

## What this book is

**1 John** is a short letter in the New Testament. It was written to help a group of early Christians stay confident in their <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a> and spot misleading ideas.

## What it contains

### 1) The big message: <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is light, so live in the light

The letter says that **<a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is “light”**, a word picture meaning <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is good and truthful, not evil. The writer tells the readers to “walk in the light”, meaning to live honestly and do what is right.

It says people still do wrong things, even if they believe in <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>. But the letter says they should **admit their sins** (wrongdoing) and trust that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> forgives them. Christians believe Jesus helps repair people’s relationship with <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>.

### 2) How to tell what is true: belief and behaviour

The background problem is that some teachers were saying things about Jesus that the writer strongly disagreed with, especially the idea that Jesus was not truly human. The writer insists Jesus was real, not just a spiritual idea.

The letter gives “tests” for recognising real <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>:

* **Right belief**: trusting that Jesus is the Christ and came as a human.
* **Right living**: trying to obey <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s commands, especially loving others.
* **Right love**: caring for people in practical ways, not just with words.
The writer says that people who claim to know <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> but live in a cruel, dishonest, or selfish way are not being consistent.

### 3) Love is the centre

Over and over, 1 John returns to one main command: **love one another**. The writer says this is not a new idea, but it is the clearest sign of genuine <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>.

A famous line from the letter is **“<a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is love.”** It teaches that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s love is shown through Jesus, and that people should copy that love by caring for others. It says love is meant to push out fear, especially fear about judgement.

### 4) Confidence and warning

The writer wants readers to feel **assurance**: confidence that they belong to <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>. But there is also a warning: do not be pulled away by teachers who deny Jesus or encourage unloving behaviour. The letter calls those kinds of influences “antichrist”, meaning people or ideas that oppose Christ.

### 5) How it ends

1 John finishes by saying the letter was written so believers can **know** they have “eternal life” (life with <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> that lasts). It also gives a final practical warning to stay away from <a href="glossary.md#idol" title="An object or false god treated as most important.">idols</a>, meaning anything that replaces <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> as the most important thing.

## Big ideas

* Belief and behaviour are linked: what people say they believe should match how they live.
* Love is treated as the clearest sign of real <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>.
* The letter aims to give confidence while warning against misleading teaching.
