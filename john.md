# John

## What this book is

The book of John is one of the four <a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospels</span></a>, the books that tell the story of Jesus’ life. John’s <a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospel</span></a> is written to help readers understand who Jesus is, and why trusting him matters.

## What it contains

It begins with a poetic introduction that describes Jesus as the “Word,” meaning <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s message and action coming into the world as a real human being. John also introduces John the Baptist, a teacher who points people toward Jesus.

After that, John tells a series of key events and teachings. John often calls Jesus’ miracles “signs,” because they are meant to show something about Jesus, not just amaze people. Some famous signs include turning water into wine at a wedding, healing people who are very sick, feeding a huge crowd with a small amount of food, walking on water, giving sight to a man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead.

John includes long conversations where Jesus explains ideas using pictures and metaphors. For example, Jesus talks about being “born again,” meaning a fresh start in life with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>. He calls himself “the bread of life,” “the light of the world,” “the good shepherd,” and “the true vine.” These are ways of explaining that he guides, feeds, protects, and connects people to <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>. John also shows growing conflict between Jesus and some religious leaders, especially when Jesus makes big claims about his close relationship with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>.

A major part of the book focuses on Jesus’ final week in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>, around <a href="glossary.md#passover"><span title="A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.">Passover</span></a>, a Jewish festival that remembers <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> rescuing <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> from slavery in Egypt. John describes the Last Supper in a different way than some other <a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospels</span></a>. Instead of focusing mainly on bread and wine, John highlights Jesus washing his <a href="glossary.md#disciple"><span title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</span></a>’ feet. This is a lesson that leadership should look like humble service. Jesus also teaches about love, unity, and the coming “Helper,” the <a href="glossary.md#holy-spirit"><span title="God’s active presence helping and guiding people (Christian belief).">Holy Spirit</span></a>, which Christians understand as <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s presence and power with believers.

John then tells the story of Jesus’ arrest, trial, <a href="glossary.md#crucifixion"><span title="Roman execution on a cross.">crucifixion</span></a>, and death. He emphasizes that Jesus chooses to face this, and that it fits within <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s plan.

Finally, John describes Jesus rising from the dead (which Christians believe happened) and appearing to his followers, including a <a href="glossary.md#disciple"><span title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciple</span></a> named Thomas who struggles to believe at first. The book ends by saying these stories were written so readers might believe Jesus is the <a href="glossary.md#messiah"><span title="“Anointed one”; a chosen leader. Christians apply it to Jesus.">Messiah</span></a> (a promised leader and rescuer) and have life through him.
