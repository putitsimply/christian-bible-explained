# John

## What this book is

The book of John is one of the four [Gospels](glossary.md#gospel "“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life."), the books that tell the story of Jesus’ life. John’s [Gospel](glossary.md#gospel "“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.") is written to help readers understand who Jesus is, and why trusting him matters.

## What it contains

It begins with a poetic introduction that describes Jesus as the “Word,” meaning [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s message and action coming into the world as a real human being. John also introduces John the Baptist, a teacher who points people toward Jesus.

After that, John tells a series of key events and teachings. John often calls Jesus’ miracles “signs,” because they are meant to show something about Jesus, not just amaze people. Some famous signs include turning water into wine at a wedding, healing people who are very sick, feeding a huge crowd with a small amount of food, walking on water, giving sight to a man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead.

John includes long conversations where Jesus explains ideas using pictures and metaphors. For example, Jesus talks about being “born again,” meaning a fresh start in life with [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity."). He calls himself “the bread of life,” “the light of the world,” “the good shepherd,” and “the true vine.” These are ways of explaining that he guides, feeds, protects, and connects people to [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity."). John also shows growing conflict between Jesus and some religious leaders, especially when Jesus makes big claims about his close relationship with [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.").

A major part of the book focuses on Jesus’ final week in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem "A major city in the Bible’s story."), around [Passover](glossary.md#passover "A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt."), a Jewish festival that remembers [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.") rescuing [Israel](glossary.md#israel "Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.") from slavery in Egypt. John describes the Last Supper in a different way than some other [Gospels](glossary.md#gospel "“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life."). Instead of focusing mainly on bread and wine, John highlights Jesus washing his [disciples](glossary.md#disciple "A close student or follower of a teacher.")’ feet. This is a lesson that leadership should look like humble service. Jesus also teaches about love, unity, and the coming “Helper,” the [Holy Spirit](glossary.md#holy-spirit "God’s active presence helping and guiding people (Christian belief)."), which Christians understand as [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s presence and power with believers.

John then tells the story of Jesus’ arrest, trial, [crucifixion](glossary.md#crucifixion "Roman execution on a cross."), and death. He emphasizes that Jesus chooses to face this, and that it fits within [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s plan.

Finally, John describes Jesus rising from the dead (which Christians believe happened) and appearing to his followers, including a [disciple](glossary.md#disciple "A close student or follower of a teacher.") named Thomas who struggles to believe at first. The book ends by saying these stories were written so readers might believe Jesus is the [Messiah](glossary.md#messiah "“Anointed one”; a chosen leader. Christians apply it to Jesus.") (a promised leader and rescuer) and have life through him.

## Big ideas

* John uses “signs” and long conversations to explain what it means to trust Jesus.
* Big images and metaphors are used to describe who Jesus is and what he offers.
* The story climaxes in [crucifixion](glossary.md#crucifixion "Roman execution on a cross.") and (in Christian belief) [resurrection](glossary.md#resurrection "Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose."), with a focus on meaning.
