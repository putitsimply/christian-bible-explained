# John

## What this book is

The book of John is one of the four [Gospels[^gl_gospel]](glossary.md#gospel), the books that tell the story of Jesus’ life. John’s [Gospel](glossary.md#gospel) is written to help readers understand who Jesus is, and why trusting him matters.

## What it contains

It begins with a poetic introduction that describes Jesus as the “Word,” meaning [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s message and action coming into the world as a real human being. John also introduces John the Baptist, a teacher who points people toward Jesus.

After that, John tells a series of key events and teachings. John often calls Jesus’ miracles “signs,” because they are meant to show something about Jesus, not just amaze people. Some famous signs include turning water into wine at a wedding, healing people who are very sick, feeding a huge crowd with a small amount of food, walking on water, giving sight to a man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead.

John includes long conversations where Jesus explains ideas using pictures and metaphors. For example, Jesus talks about being “born again,” meaning a fresh start in life with [God](glossary.md#god). He calls himself “the bread of life,” “the light of the world,” “the good shepherd,” and “the true vine.” These are ways of explaining that he guides, feeds, protects, and connects people to [God](glossary.md#god). John also shows growing conflict between Jesus and some religious leaders, especially when Jesus makes big claims about his close relationship with [God](glossary.md#god).

A major part of the book focuses on Jesus’ final week in [Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]](glossary.md#jerusalem), around [Passover[^gl_passover]](glossary.md#passover), a Jewish festival that remembers [God](glossary.md#god) rescuing [Israel[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) from slavery in Egypt. John describes the Last Supper in a different way than some other [Gospels](glossary.md#gospel). Instead of focusing mainly on bread and wine, John highlights Jesus washing his [disciples[^gl_disciple]](glossary.md#disciple)’ feet. This is a lesson that leadership should look like humble service. Jesus also teaches about love, unity, and the coming “Helper,” the [Holy Spirit[^gl_holy_spirit]](glossary.md#holy-spirit), which Christians understand as [God](glossary.md#god)’s presence and power with believers.

John then tells the story of Jesus’ arrest, trial, [crucifixion[^gl_crucifixion]](glossary.md#crucifixion), and death. He emphasizes that Jesus chooses to face this, and that it fits within [God](glossary.md#god)’s plan.

Finally, John describes Jesus rising from the dead (which Christians believe happened) and appearing to his followers, including a [disciple](glossary.md#disciple) named Thomas who struggles to believe at first. The book ends by saying these stories were written so readers might believe Jesus is the [Messiah[^gl_messiah]](glossary.md#messiah) (a promised leader and rescuer) and have life through him.
