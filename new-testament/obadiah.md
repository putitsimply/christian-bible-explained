# Obadiah

[![Edom and the Land of Seir – Bible Mapper Atlas](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.jPOi1FbHVIf7zOABKeo2LwHaKz?cb=ucfimg2\&pid=Api\&ucfimg=1)](https://biblemapper.com/blog/index.php/2024/02/25/edom-and-the-land-of-seir/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament, only 21 verses. It is a message (often called a “prophecy”, meaning a message someone believes comes from God) aimed at a nation called **Edom**, which lived near Judah, on the other side of the Dead Sea. ([BibleProject](https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-obadiah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### What happens in the book

**1) Obadiah says Edom will be brought down (Obadiah 1 to 9).**\
The book begins with an announcement that Edom is going to fall from power. Edom is described as feeling very safe because of its rocky, high places, but the message says that their **pride** has tricked them and they will be humbled.

**2) Obadiah explains why Edom is in trouble (Obadiah 10 to 14).**\
The main reason is how Edom acted when **Jerusalem was attacked and conquered**. Obadiah criticises Edom for standing by instead of helping, and for taking advantage of Judah’s suffering rather than showing care.

**3) The message widens out to a bigger idea: the “Day of the Lord” (Obadiah 15 to 16).**\
“Day of the Lord” is a Bible phrase for a time when God is pictured as stepping in to judge unfairness and set things right. In Obadiah, the point is that what Edom did will come back on them, and the same kind of justice will apply to other nations too.

**4) The book ends with hope for Judah and a final claim about God’s rule (Obadiah 17 to 21).**\
After judgement, Obadiah pictures Judah being restored and safe again, and it ends with the line that **“the kingdom will be the Lord’s”**, meaning God’s authority is shown as the final outcome.
