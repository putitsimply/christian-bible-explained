# Proverbs

Proverbs is a book of short teachings that aim to train people to live wisely. It is not written as one long story, it is more like a collection of guidance sayings and poems, mostly connected with King Solomon (known in the Bible as a wise king), plus some sayings from other teachers.

#### What the book is trying to do

Right at the start, Proverbs says its goal is to teach “wisdom” and “good judgement.” In simple terms, wisdom here means skill for living, knowing how to make choices that lead to good outcomes, not just knowing facts.

A big theme is that wisdom begins with “the fear of the Lord.” That phrase can sound scary, but in this context it means deep respect for God and taking right and wrong seriously.

#### The main parts of Proverbs

**1) A parent teaching a child (chapters 1 to 9)**\
The opening section is longer speeches, often sounding like a father or mother coaching their child. It warns strongly against being pulled into violence, stealing, corruption, and sexual exploitation. It also includes poems where “Wisdom” is described like a person calling out in the streets, inviting people to learn. There is also a contrasting character, sometimes called “Folly,” who tempts people into choices that feel good now but end in harm later.

**2) Hundreds of short sayings (chapters 10 to 29)**\
This is the part many people recognise. It is a long collection of bite sized proverbs, usually only one or two lines each. They cover everyday life topics such as:

* honesty vs lying
* working hard vs being lazy
* controlling anger
* using words carefully
* money and generosity
* friendships and family life
* fairness and justice
* listening to advice\
  These sayings are not promises that life will always be simple, they are general patterns about how life often works.

**3) Wisdom from other voices (chapters 30 to 31)**\
Near the end, there are sayings linked to a man named Agur, and advice linked to King Lemuel, including what his mother taught him. The book finishes with a famous poem describing a “capable” or “wise” woman, showing strength, responsibility, generosity, and practical skill.

#### The overall message

Proverbs teaches that choices shape character, and character shapes life. It invites readers to become the kind of person who tells the truth, treats others fairly, works steadily, and thinks before speaking, because that is the path it calls “wise.”
