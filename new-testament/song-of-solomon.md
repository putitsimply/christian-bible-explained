# Song of Solomon

Song of Solomon, also called Song of Songs, is a book of poetry about love. It is not a story with battles or kings. Instead, it is a set of love poems where different voices speak, mainly a young woman and a young man, and sometimes a group called “friends” or “daughters of Jerusalem” (like a chorus in a play).

Here is what happens, in a simple timeline:

* **Two lovers speak to each other.** They describe how much they admire one another, using lots of nature pictures like vineyards, gardens, lilies, deer, spices, and fruit. The language is very artistic and sometimes intense, because it is poetry.
* **They long to be together.** Several poems show the woman searching for her beloved in the city at night, or dreaming about him, or wanting him to come to her. The man also speaks about wanting to be near her.
* **There are scenes that sound like a wedding.** Some parts describe a grand arrival like a wedding procession, and there are strong hints of marriage and commitment. Other parts sound like courtship (getting to know and choosing each other) and the excitement around it.
* **Love is praised as powerful and protective.** Near the end, the book says love is very strong, hard to stop, and not something you can buy with money. It treats love as precious and serious.

Because it is poetry, the book does not always move in a straight line. It can jump between scenes, memories, and dreams, like songs on an album that share the same theme.

People interpret the book in different ways:

* **As romantic poetry:** celebrating love, attraction, commitment, and the goodness of marriage.
* **As an allegory:** an allegory is a story or poem that also stands for something else. Some readers see the lovers as symbolising God’s love for his people, or in Christian teaching, Christ’s love for the church.

Either way, the main focus of Song of Solomon is the beauty, joy, and seriousness of faithful love.
