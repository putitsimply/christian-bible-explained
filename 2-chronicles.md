# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah), the southern kingdom of [Israel[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel), from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian [exile[^gl_exile]](glossary.md#exile) and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah) (especially [Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]](glossary.md#jerusalem) and the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple)), rather than the northern kingdom ([Israel[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel)).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) for wisdom, building the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) in [Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]](glossary.md#jerusalem), and leading a time of wealth and stability. The [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) is described as the centre of [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship), and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah). Some kings are shown as trying to follow [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to [idols[^gl_idol]](glossary.md#idol) (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) at the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple).

* Asa removes [idols[^gl_idol]](glossary.md#idol) and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith).
* Jehoshaphat strengthens [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah) and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) and celebrates a major [Passover[^gl_passover]](glossary.md#passover) (a festival remembering [Israel[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel)’s escape from slavery in Egypt). [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah) survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple), finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship). He also restores [Passover[^gl_passover]](glossary.md#passover) celebrations.
The book also includes messages from [prophets[^gl_prophet]](glossary.md#prophet), who are people believed to speak [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s warnings and guidance. Often the [prophets[^gl_prophet]](glossary.md#prophet) call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop [idol[^gl_idol]](glossary.md#idol) [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) and injustice.

In the later chapters, [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah)’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers [Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]](glossary.md#jerusalem), the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple), which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) at the [temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after [exile[^gl_exile]](glossary.md#exile): rebuilding is possible.
