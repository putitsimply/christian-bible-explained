# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a>, the southern kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>, from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian <a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a> and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> (especially <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a>), rather than the northern kingdom (<a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> for wisdom, building the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a> in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>, and leading a time of wealth and stability. The <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a> is described as the centre of <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>, and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a>. Some kings are shown as trying to follow <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to <a href="glossary.md#idol" title="An object or false god treated as most important.">idols</a> (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> at the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a>.

* Asa removes <a href="glossary.md#idol" title="An object or false god treated as most important.">idols</a> and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>.
* Jehoshaphat strengthens <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a> <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> and celebrates a major <a href="glossary.md#passover" title="A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.">Passover</a> (a festival remembering <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>’s escape from slavery in Egypt). <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a>, finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>. He also restores <a href="glossary.md#passover" title="A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.">Passover</a> celebrations.
The book also includes messages from <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</a>, who are people believed to speak <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s warnings and guidance. Often the <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</a> call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop <a href="glossary.md#idol" title="An object or false god treated as most important.">idol</a> <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> and injustice.

In the later chapters, <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a>’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a> is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a>, which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> at the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a> and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after <a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a>: rebuilding is possible.
