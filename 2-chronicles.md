# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem."), the southern kingdom of [Israel](glossary.md#israel "Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people."), from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian [exile](glossary.md#exile "Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.") and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.") (especially [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem "A major city in the Bible’s story.") and the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.")), rather than the northern kingdom ([Israel](glossary.md#israel "Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.")).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.") for wisdom, building the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem "A major city in the Bible’s story."), and leading a time of wealth and stability. The [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") is described as the centre of [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals)."), and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem."). Some kings are shown as trying to follow [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.") and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to [idols](glossary.md#idol "An object or false god treated as most important.") (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).") at the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.").

* Asa removes [idols](glossary.md#idol "An object or false god treated as most important.") and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of [faith](glossary.md#faith "Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.").
* Jehoshaphat strengthens [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.") and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).") and celebrates a major [Passover](glossary.md#passover "A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.") (a festival remembering [Israel](glossary.md#israel "Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.")’s escape from slavery in Egypt). [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.") survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel."), finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals)."). He also restores [Passover](glossary.md#passover "A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.") celebrations.
The book also includes messages from [prophets](glossary.md#prophet "A person who speaks messages they believe come from God."), who are people believed to speak [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s warnings and guidance. Often the [prophets](glossary.md#prophet "A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.") call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop [idol](glossary.md#idol "An object or false god treated as most important.") [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).") and injustice.

In the later chapters, [Judah](glossary.md#judah "The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.")’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem "A major city in the Bible’s story."), the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel."), which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).") at the [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after [exile](glossary.md#exile "Being forced to live away from one’s homeland."): rebuilding is possible.
