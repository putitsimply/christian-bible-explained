# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of Judah[^gl-judah], the southern kingdom of Israel[^gl-israel], from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian exile[^gl-exile] and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on Judah[^gl-judah] (especially Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] and the temple[^gl-temple]), rather than the northern kingdom (Israel[^gl-israel]).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking God[^gl-god] for wisdom, building the temple[^gl-temple] in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem], and leading a time of wealth and stability. The temple[^gl-temple] is described as the centre of worship[^gl-worship], and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in Judah[^gl-judah]. Some kings are shown as trying to follow God[^gl-god] and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to idols (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to worship[^gl-worship] at the temple[^gl-temple].

* Asa removes idols and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of faith[^gl-faith].
* Jehoshaphat strengthens Judah[^gl-judah] and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores temple[^gl-temple] worship[^gl-worship] and celebrates a major Passover[^gl-passover] (a festival remembering Israel[^gl-israel]’s escape from slavery in Egypt). Judah[^gl-judah] survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the temple[^gl-temple], finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of God[^gl-god]’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of worship[^gl-worship]. He also restores Passover[^gl-passover] celebrations.

The book also includes messages from prophets[^gl-prophet], who are people believed to speak God[^gl-god]’s warnings and guidance. Often the prophets[^gl-prophet] call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop idol[^gl-idol] worship[^gl-worship] and injustice.

In the later chapters, Judah[^gl-judah]’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem], the temple[^gl-temple] is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the temple[^gl-temple], which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support worship[^gl-worship] at the temple[^gl-temple] and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after exile[^gl-exile]: rebuilding is possible.
