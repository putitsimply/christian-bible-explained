# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah], the southern kingdom of [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel], from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian [exile](glossary.md#exile)[^gl-exile] and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah] (especially [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem)[^gl-jerusalem] and the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple]), rather than the northern kingdom ([Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel]).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] for wisdom, building the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple] in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem)[^gl-jerusalem], and leading a time of wealth and stability. The [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple] is described as the centre of [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship], and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah]. Some kings are shown as trying to follow [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to idols (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship] at the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple].

* Asa removes idols and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of [faith](glossary.md#faith)[^gl-faith].
* Jehoshaphat strengthens [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah] and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple] [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship] and celebrates a major [Passover](glossary.md#passover)[^gl-passover] (a festival remembering [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel]’s escape from slavery in Egypt). [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah] survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple], finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship]. He also restores [Passover](glossary.md#passover)[^gl-passover] celebrations.
The book also includes messages from [prophets](glossary.md#prophet)[^gl-prophet], who are people believed to speak [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s warnings and guidance. Often the [prophets](glossary.md#prophet)[^gl-prophet] call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop [idol](glossary.md#idol)[^gl-idol] [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship] and injustice.

In the later chapters, [Judah](glossary.md#judah)[^gl-judah]’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem)[^gl-jerusalem], the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple] is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple], which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support [worship](glossary.md#worship)[^gl-worship] at the [temple](glossary.md#temple)[^gl-temple] and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after [exile](glossary.md#exile)[^gl-exile]: rebuilding is possible.
