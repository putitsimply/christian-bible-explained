# 2 Chronicles

## What this book is

2 Chronicles is a history-style book that retells the story of Judah[^gl_judah], the southern kingdom of Israel[^gl_israel], from Solomon’s reign through to the Babylonian exile[^gl_exile] and then a hint of return. It focuses mostly on Judah (especially Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] and the temple[^gl_temple]), rather than the northern kingdom (Israel).

## What it contains

It starts with King Solomon, David’s son. Solomon becomes famous for asking God[^gl_god] for wisdom, building the temple in Jerusalem, and leading a time of wealth and stability. The temple is described as the centre of worship[^gl_worship], and there is a big dedication ceremony where Solomon prays and people celebrate.

After Solomon dies, the kingdom is split. 2 Chronicles mostly follows the line of kings in Judah. Some kings are shown as trying to follow God and lead the people well, while others are shown as turning to idols[^gl_idol] (worshipping other gods) and acting unfairly. The book often connects a king’s choices with what happens next, like peace, trouble, or invasion.

Several kings stand out for reforms, which means they try to fix problems and bring the nation back to worship at the temple.

* Asa removes idols and pushes for religious changes, but later makes mistakes by relying on political deals instead of faith[^gl_faith].
* Jehoshaphat strengthens Judah and is remembered for teaching the people and trying to rule fairly, but he also makes risky alliances.
* Hezekiah restores temple worship and celebrates a major Passover[^gl_passover] (a festival remembering Israel’s escape from slavery in Egypt). Judah survives a serious threat from Assyria during his time.
* Josiah is known for repairing the temple, finding the “Book of the Law” (a written set of God’s instructions), and leading a big renewal of worship. He also restores Passover celebrations.
The book also includes messages from prophets[^gl_prophet], who are people believed to speak God’s warnings and guidance. Often the prophets call the leaders and people to change their behaviour, especially to stop idol worship and injustice.

In the later chapters, Judah’s kings become more unfaithful, and the people ignore repeated warnings. Eventually Babylon conquers Jerusalem, the temple is destroyed, and many people are taken away from their land. The book ends with a decree from King Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiled people to go back and rebuild the temple, which points to hope after disaster.

## Big ideas

* Kings are judged mainly by whether they support worship at the temple and live justly.
* The story repeatedly links reform with renewal, and unfaithfulness with decline and disaster.
* The ending points to hope after exile: rebuilding is possible.
