# Daniel

*Where this book fits:* [Old Testament](old-testament.md) → [Major prophets](ot-major-prophets.md)

## What this book is

Daniel is set when many Jewish people have been taken away from their homeland to Babylon (this is called **exile[^gl_exile]**, which means being forced to live in another country). It mixes court stories (life in an empire) with later, highly symbolic visions.

The first half is made of dramatic stories about identity and courage under pressure. The second half uses symbols to talk about hope when history feels scary.

## What it contains

Daniel and a few other young men, like **Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah** (often known by their Babylonian names **Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego**), are trained to work for the Babylonian king. They try to stay loyal to their faith[^gl_faith] while living in a powerful empire with different beliefs.

Early on, Daniel and his friends refuse food that would break their religious rules and choose a simple diet instead, showing commitment under pressure.

Daniel becomes well known because he can explain dreams that no one else can, including troubling dreams of King **Nebuchadnezzar**. Later, Nebuchadnezzar builds a huge golden statue and demands everyone worship[^gl_worship] it. Daniel’s three friends refuse and survive a blazing furnace.

Another well known story happens at a royal feast under a later Babylonian ruler. A mysterious message appears on the wall (“writing on the wall”), and no one can understand it. Daniel is brought in and explains it as a warning that the kingdom’s power is about to end.

Another famous story happens under a later ruler. Daniel keeps praying to God[^gl_god] even when a law is made to stop it. Because he breaks that law, he is thrown into a den of lions and survives the night.

The second half of Daniel has strange, symbolic visions, like beasts, horns, and mysterious numbers. This style is often called **apocalyptic[^gl_apocalyptic_writing]** writing: it uses dramatic symbols to talk about evil, justice, and hope. The message is that cruel power does not last forever, and God will set things right.

## Big ideas

* Staying loyal to one’s beliefs can be costly, but the stories highlight courage under pressure.
* Empires and rulers look powerful, but the book keeps reminding readers that power changes and does not last.
* The visions use symbols to express hope that injustice and cruelty will not win forever.

Daniel has been read in many different ways, but the book’s overall message is to keep courage and hope in hard times.
