# Daniel

## What this book is

Daniel is set when many Jewish people have been taken away from their homeland to Babylon (this is called **[exile](glossary.md#exile) [^gl-exile]**, which means being forced to live in another country). It mixes court stories (life in an empire) with later, highly symbolic visions.

## What it contains

Daniel and a few other young men, like **Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah** (often known by their Babylonian names **Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego**), are trained to work for the Babylonian king. They try to stay loyal to their [faith](glossary.md#faith) [^gl-faith] while living in a powerful empire with different beliefs.

Early on, Daniel and his friends refuse food that would break their religious rules. They ask for a simple diet instead, and they end up healthier than the others. This shows their commitment and also sets up a big theme of the book: staying faithful under pressure.

Daniel becomes well known because he can explain dreams that no one else can. King **Nebuchadnezzar** has a troubling dream, and Daniel explains it, saying it points to a series of kingdoms rising and falling, and that human power does not last forever. Later, Nebuchadnezzar builds a huge golden statue and demands everyone [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] it. Daniel’s three friends refuse, and they are thrown into a blazing furnace, but they survive. The story highlights courage and the idea that faithfulness can be tested in extreme ways.

Another famous story happens under a later ruler. Daniel keeps praying to [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god] even when a law is made to stop it. Because he breaks that law, he is thrown into a den of lions. He survives the night, and the king is shocked. Again, the point is not that trouble never comes, but that Daniel stays consistent even when it is risky.

The second half of Daniel has strange, symbolic visions, like beasts, horns, and mysterious numbers. These visions are often called **[apocalyptic](glossary.md#apocalyptic-writing) [^gl-apocalyptic-writing]** writing, which means a style that uses dramatic symbols to talk about big struggles between good and evil, and about [God](glossary.md#god)’s justice in the end. The visions say that evil powers will not last forever, and that in the long run [God](glossary.md#god) will set things right.

Overall, Daniel mixes exciting stories with mysterious visions to teach that courage, faithfulness, and hope matter, especially when people feel small compared to governments or empires.
