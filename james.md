# James

## What this book is

The book of James is a short letter in the New Testament that focuses on how [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith) should show up in everyday life. It is much more about practical actions than deep arguments.

## What it contains

James writes to Jewish followers of Jesus who are living in different places, often under pressure. He starts by saying that hard times can test people, and that this testing can build endurance and maturity. He tells people to ask [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) for wisdom when they are stuck, and to ask with trust instead of constantly switching between doubt and confidence.

A big theme is that listening and doing matter. James says people should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. He warns that it is easy to hear religious teaching, agree with it, and then live as if it makes no difference. He compares this to looking in a mirror and then forgetting what they look like.

James also talks about fairness and how communities treat people. He criticises showing special treatment to rich or important-looking people while ignoring the poor. He argues that this goes against loving one’s neighbour, and he warns that wealth can become a trap if it leads to pride or unfair behaviour.

One of the most famous parts is about “[faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith) and works.” James says that if someone claims to have [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith) but never helps anyone and never changes how they live, that [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith) is empty. His point is that real trust in [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) should produce visible results, like generosity, self-control, and courage to do what is right.

James spends time on speech, especially the tongue. He says words are powerful, like a small spark that can start a big fire. He warns against gossip, insults, and saying one thing in [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) and another thing in everyday life.

Near the end, James challenges pride and selfish ambition. He says quarrels often come from wanting things too much. He encourages humility, peacemaking, and planning life with the attitude, “If the Lord wills,” meaning recognising that humans are not in control of everything.

He finishes with advice about patience during suffering, honesty, and [prayer[^gl_prayer]](glossary.md#prayer). He says people should pray in trouble, sing in joy, and pray for the sick. He also encourages the community to bring someone back if they wander away from the right path.

Overall, James teaches that genuine [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith) is meant to be lived out through character and action.
