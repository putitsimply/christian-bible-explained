# Nahum

## What this book is

Nahum is a short book in the Old Testament. It is mainly about one thing: the coming fall of **Nineveh**, the capital city of **Assyria**.

## What it contains

### The background

Assyria was a powerful empire that had hurt many nations, including [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god]’s people. In the [Bible](glossary.md#bible) [^gl-bible] story, Assyria had already conquered the northern kingdom of [Israel](glossary.md#israel) [^gl-israel] and caused a lot of suffering. So for many people in [Judah](glossary.md#judah) [^gl-judah] (the southern kingdom), Assyria felt scary and unstoppable.

Nahum is presented as a **[prophet](glossary.md#prophet) [^gl-prophet]**, meaning someone who speaks a message they believe comes from [God](glossary.md#god). His message is not mainly “do this, don’t do that,” but “this is what is going to happen.”

### What happens in the book

**Chapter 1:**\
Nahum begins by describing [God](glossary.md#god) as patient but also serious about justice. The big idea is: evil does not last forever, and no empire is too strong to be held accountable. Nahum says this message is “good news” for people who have been crushed by violence and bullying. At the same time, it is bad news for Nineveh.

**Chapter 2:**\
Nahum switches into vivid, action-packed poetry that describes Nineveh being attacked and collapsing. He talks about armies advancing, city defences breaking, people fleeing, and the city’s wealth being taken away. It is written like a dramatic scene, even though it is a prophecy.

**Chapter 3:**\
Nahum explains why Nineveh is being judged. He describes the city as built on violence, lies, and cruelty. He also mocks Nineveh’s confidence and says it is not truly safe. The book ends by saying that many nations will celebrate Nineveh’s fall because so many people had suffered under Assyria’s power.

## Big ideas

Nahum is meant to comfort the oppressed and warn the powerful. Its message is that cruelty and injustice might look like they are winning for a while, but they do not get the last word. In the [Bible](glossary.md#bible)’s storyline, the fall of Nineveh shows that even the biggest empire can fall.
