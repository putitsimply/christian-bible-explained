# Luke

## What this book is

Luke is one of the four “<a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospels</span></a>” in the New Testament. A <a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospel</span></a> is a book that tells the story of Jesus’ life and teachings. Luke is written like a careful history for a reader called Theophilus, to help them understand what Christians believe about Jesus.

## What it contains

**How Luke starts**

Luke begins before Jesus is born. It tells stories about:

* **Zechariah and Elizabeth**, who become the parents of **John the Baptist**.
* **Mary**, who is told she will have a baby, Jesus.
* Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem, with angels announcing “good news” to shepherds.\
 Luke also includes family moments like Jesus being presented at the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">Temple</span></a>, and a story where 12-year-old Jesus talks with teachers in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>.

**Jesus’ early life and mission**\
Jesus is baptised by John the Baptist. Then Luke describes Jesus beginning his public work, teaching in <a href="glossary.md#synagogue"><span title="A Jewish meeting place for prayer and teaching.">synagogues</span></a> and saying his mission is to bring hope to the poor, freedom to the oppressed, and healing to those who suffer.

**What Jesus does and teaches**\
A big part of Luke is Jesus travelling, teaching, and helping people. Luke highlights that Jesus cares for people who are often pushed aside, like the sick, the poor, outsiders, and those seen as “sinners”.

Luke includes many famous stories (often told as **<a href="glossary.md#parable"><span title="A short teaching story.">parables</span></a>**, which are teaching stories with a lesson). Some well-known <a href="glossary.md#parable"><span title="A short teaching story.">parables</span></a> in Luke are:

* **The Good Samaritan**, about loving and helping others, even if they are from a different group.
* **The Prodigal Son**, about forgiveness and second chances.
* **The Lost Sheep and Lost Coin**, about searching for what matters.
Luke also shows Jesus teaching about <a href="glossary.md#prayer"><span title="Speaking to God (silently or aloud).">prayer</span></a>, generosity, and using wealth wisely. Luke often mentions the **<a href="glossary.md#holy-spirit"><span title="God’s active presence helping and guiding people (Christian belief).">Holy Spirit</span></a>**, which Christians describe as <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s active presence helping and guiding people.

**The journey to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>**\
In the second half of the book, Jesus heads toward <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>. Along the way, he keeps teaching and warning that following him can be costly, but also life-giving.

**The final week, death, and <a href="glossary.md#resurrection"><span title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</span></a>**\
Luke tells about:

* Jesus’ last meal with his <a href="glossary.md#disciple"><span title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</span></a> (often called the **Last Supper**).
* His arrest and trial.
* His <a href="glossary.md#crucifixion"><span title="Roman execution on a cross.">crucifixion</span></a> (execution on a cross).\
 Luke includes moments that stress forgiveness and compassion, even at the end.

Then Luke describes Christians’ central belief: that Jesus rises from the dead. Jesus appears to his followers, helps them understand the meaning of what happened, and tells them to share the message. Luke ends with Jesus’ **<a href="glossary.md#ascension"><span title="Jesus being taken up to heaven (Christian belief).">ascension</span></a>**, meaning he is taken up into heaven. (Luke’s author continues the story in the book of Acts.)

## Big ideas

* Luke highlights Jesus’ concern for people who are poor, sick, or pushed aside.
* The book combines stories, teachings, and <a href="glossary.md#parable"><span title="A short teaching story.">parables</span></a> to explain what Jesus is like.
* The ending leads into Acts, as the movement continues after Jesus.
