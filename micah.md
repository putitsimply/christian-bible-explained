# Micah

## What this book is

The book of Micah is a short book in the Old Testament. It is written like a set of speeches from Micah, a <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</span></a> (someone who speaks <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s message) to the people of <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> and <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a>. Micah’s main theme is this: <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> cares deeply about justice, and he also promises hope after punishment.

## What it contains

Micah begins by saying that serious trouble is coming because the people have been unfaithful and unfair. He points to big problems like worshipping other gods, cheating, and using power to hurt others. He especially criticises wealthy landowners who take property from families, and leaders and judges who accept bribes. Micah says this kind of society is the opposite of what <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> wants.

Micah warns that these wrong choices will lead to disaster. He predicts that Samaria (the capital of the northern kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>) will fall. He also warns <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a> (in the southern kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a>) that it is not safe just because it has the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a>. In other words, Micah argues that religious buildings and rituals do not “cancel out” injustice.

In the middle of the book, Micah includes a famous summary of what <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> wants from people. Instead of piles of <a href="glossary.md#sacrifice"><span title="An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).">sacrifices</span></a>, Micah says the important things are to act fairly, love kindness (meaning loyal care for others), and live humbly with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>. This is one of the clearest “what does a good life look like?” statements in the <a href="glossary.md#bible"><span title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</span></a>.

Micah also contains strong messages of hope. He says that after judgment, <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> will bring restoration. He describes a future where people from many nations learn <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s ways, and where there is real peace, pictured as people living safely and not training for war anymore. He talks about a “remnant,” meaning a smaller group of survivors who remain faithful and are renewed.

One well known part of Micah is a promise about a future ruler coming from Bethlehem. Christians later connect this to Jesus, while Jewish readers may understand it as hope for a future David-like king who would lead with justice.

So overall, Micah is a mix of warning and comfort: it condemns corruption and cruelty, but it also insists that wrongdoing is not the end of the story, and that a better, fairer future is possible.

## Big ideas

* Justice is not optional: <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> without fairness is criticised strongly.
* The book mixes warning (consequences) with hope (restoration after disaster).
* Different communities connect the “future ruler” passage to different expectations.
