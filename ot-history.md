# History (Old Testament)

These books tell long stories about Israel[^gl_israel]’s life in the land, its leaders, and major turning points. They include times of success and failure, and they explain how the kingdoms of Israel and Judah[^gl_judah] ended up conquered and exiled.

They are “history” in the sense that they tell about past events, but they are also teaching stories. The writers often point out what they think went right or wrong.
