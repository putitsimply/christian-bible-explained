# Nehemiah

## What this book is

Nehemiah is set after many Jewish people had been taken away from Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] to live in Babylon. This time away from their homeland is often called the exile[^gl-exile], which means being forced to live somewhere else. Later, the Persian Empire took control, and some Jewish people were allowed to return to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]. The city existed again, but its protective walls were still broken down, which made it unsafe and embarrassing for a city that was meant to be rebuilt.

## What it contains

Nehemiah is a Jewish man working far away in the Persian king’s palace as a cupbearer, someone trusted to serve the king’s drinks and help protect the king from poisoning. When Nehemiah hears that Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]’s walls are still ruined, he is deeply upset. He prays, then bravely asks the king for permission to go to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] and rebuild. The king agrees and gives him letters for safe travel and supplies.

When Nehemiah arrives, he quietly inspects the damaged walls at night, then he gathers the people and organises them to rebuild. Different families and groups repair different sections. The work is not easy because nearby leaders try to stop them through mocking, threats, and attempts to trick Nehemiah. Nehemiah responds by praying, staying calm, and setting up guards. There is a famous picture of the builders working while also staying ready to defend themselves.

In a surprisingly short time, the wall is finished. After that, Nehemiah focuses on rebuilding the community, not just the buildings. The people gather to hear God[^gl-god]’s Law read aloud, led by Ezra the teacher. They realise they have drifted from their beliefs and make promises to live more faithfully. They celebrate a festival, confess wrongdoing, and agree on practical changes, like supporting the temple[^gl-temple], keeping the Sabbath[^gl-sabbath] as a day of rest, and avoiding unfair marriages that could pull them away from their faith[^gl-faith].

Nehemiah also tackles serious social problems. Some wealthy Jewish people were using loans and debts to take land from poorer families. Nehemiah calls this out and pushes for fairness, showing that rebuilding a society includes justice, not only construction.

Near the end, Nehemiah returns briefly to Persia, then comes back to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] and finds old problems returning. He reforms things again, including misuse of temple[^gl-temple] rooms, people working and trading on the Sabbath[^gl-sabbath], and mixed marriages that were causing conflict about identity and worship[^gl-worship].

Overall, Nehemiah is about strong leadership, prayer[^gl-prayer], teamwork, courage under pressure, and rebuilding both physical walls and community values.
