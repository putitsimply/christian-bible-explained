# Esther

## What this book is

The book of Esther is set in the Persian Empire (a huge kingdom that ruled many lands). It tells a story about danger, courage, and a surprising turn of events.

## What it contains

A Persian king (often called Ahasuerus in the Bible) holds a big royal feast. During it, he becomes angry with Queen Vashti and removes her as queen. After that, the king’s officials organise a search for a new queen from across the empire. A young Jewish woman named Esther is chosen and becomes queen, but she does not tell anyone she is Jewish. Esther is being cared for by her older cousin (or guardian) Mordecai, who works near the palace gates.

Mordecai discovers a plot to assassinate the king and reports it, which saves the king’s life. This is written down in the royal records, but at the time Mordecai is not rewarded.

Then a powerful official named Haman rises in status. Haman expects everyone to bow to him, but Mordecai refuses. Haman becomes furious, not just at Mordecai, but at Mordecai’s whole people. Haman convinces the king to make a law to wipe out all the Jews in the empire on a set day, and a date is chosen by casting lots (this is where the festival name “Purim” comes from).

When Esther hears about the law, she faces a hard choice. Approaching the king without being invited could get her killed. Mordecai urges her to act, suggesting she may have become queen “for such a time as this”, meaning for this very moment of need. Esther asks the Jewish people to fast (go without food for a time to focus on prayer and seeking help), and she fasts too. Then she bravely goes to the king.

Esther invites the king and Haman to two special meals (banquets). At the second banquet, she reveals that she is Jewish and exposes Haman’s plan as a threat to her life and her people. The king is outraged. Haman is punished, and Mordecai is honoured instead. The story flips completely: Mordecai is given a high position, and a new royal order allows the Jewish people to defend themselves when the set day comes.

The book ends with the Jewish people surviving, their enemies being stopped, and the festival of Purim being established to remember their rescue.

A notable detail: the book of Esther never directly mentions God by name, but many readers see the events as showing hidden guidance and protection.

## Big ideas

* Courage can mean taking a risk for other people’s safety.
* The story shows how power can be abused (and sometimes turned around).
* Even without mentioning God directly, the book explores themes of hidden help, timing, and survival.
