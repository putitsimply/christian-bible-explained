# Deuteronomy

## What this book is

Deuteronomy is the last book of the [Torah](glossary.md#torah) [^gl-torah], the first five books of the [Bible](glossary.md#bible) [^gl-bible]. It mainly takes place near the end of [Israel](glossary.md#israel) [^gl-israel]’s long journey from Egypt to the edge of the Promised Land. The people are camped on the plains of Moab, just across the Jordan River, and Moses is very old. He knows he will not enter the land, so he gives a series of important speeches to prepare the next generation.

## What it contains

Here is what happens, in a clear order:

**1) Moses retells the story so far.**

Moses reminds the people how they left Egypt, how they wandered in the wilderness for many years, and why. A key point is that the earlier generation often refused to trust and obey [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god], which led to delays and hardship.

**2) Moses repeats and explains [God](glossary.md#god)’s laws.**

A big part of Deuteronomy is a “second telling” of the law. It repeats many rules found earlier (especially from Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers), but often with extra explanation, examples, and reasons. Moses highlights everyday life topics like honesty, caring for the poor, fair courts, family responsibilities, and how to treat strangers kindly.

**3) The [covenant](glossary.md#covenant) [^gl-covenant] is renewed.**

A [covenant](glossary.md#covenant) is a serious relationship agreement, like a treaty, with promises and responsibilities on both sides. Moses calls the people to renew their [covenant](glossary.md#covenant) with [God](glossary.md#god) before entering the land, because they will face new temptations and pressures once they settle.

**4) The most famous teaching: love [God](glossary.md#god) wholeheartedly.**

Moses teaches that the people should love [God](glossary.md#god) with their whole heart, soul, and strength, and pass this teaching on to their children. This passage is often called the “Shema,” which is the first word of it in Hebrew and means “Hear.”

**5) Blessings and warnings.**

Moses lays out consequences. If the people follow [God](glossary.md#god)’s ways, there will be blessings like stability and peace. If they reject those ways, there will be serious troubles. The message is meant to be a warning before problems happen, not just a punishment afterward.

**6) A new leader is appointed.**

Moses publicly hands leadership to Joshua, who will lead the people into the Promised Land.

**7) Moses’ final moments.**

Near the end, Moses teaches the people a song, gives final blessings to the tribes, then goes up a mountain, sees the land from a distance, and dies. The book ends by honouring Moses as a great leader and [prophet](glossary.md#prophet) [^gl-prophet].

## Big ideas

* A “new generation” is reminded what happened before, so they can choose more wisely.
* Law is presented as practical guidance for everyday life (especially justice and care for others).
* The book is a farewell from Moses, looking back and looking ahead at the same time.
