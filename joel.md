# Joel

## What this book is

The book of Joel is a short book in the Old Testament. It uses a natural disaster, a huge locust plague, as a big warning story about what happens when a whole community ignores what is right.

## What it contains

### 1) A disaster hits, and everyone is told to pay attention

Joel describes an overwhelming locust swarm that strips the land bare. Crops are ruined, food is scarce, and even the things used for [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] (like grain and wine offerings) cannot be provided because the harvest is gone. Joel calls on different groups, farmers, [priests](glossary.md#priest) [^gl-priest], and all the people, to recognise how serious this is.

### 2) The disaster is treated as a “wake up” call

Joel explains the plague as more than just bad luck. He treats it as a message calling the community to stop and think about their lives and choices. He urges the nation to turn back to [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god] with honesty, not just with sad feelings or public show. In other words, he says real change matters more than pretending.

### 3) A whole-community moment of repentance

Joel calls for a special gathering where everyone comes together, including children, elders, and even newlyweds. The [priests](glossary.md#priest) are told to pray for the people and ask for mercy. This part shows the idea that a community can share responsibility, and can also seek healing together.

### 4) Hope: restoration after turning back

Joel then shifts from warning to hope. He says that if the people truly return to [God](glossary.md#god), the land can recover. Fields can grow again, rain can return, and the years “eaten” by the locusts can be restored. The message is that consequences can be real, but so can forgiveness and rebuilding.

### 5) “[God](glossary.md#god)’s Spirit” promised for everyone

One of the most famous parts of Joel is a promise that [God](glossary.md#god)’s Spirit will be poured out on all kinds of people, not just leaders: sons and daughters, old and young, servants too. “Spirit” here means [God](glossary.md#god)’s empowering presence, helping people speak truth, live wisely, and stay faithful. In the New Testament, this passage is linked to [Pentecost](glossary.md#pentecost) [^gl-pentecost] (in Acts 2), when Jesus’ followers believe this promise is being fulfilled.

### 6) Justice in the end

Joel finishes with a picture of [God](glossary.md#god) bringing justice: wrongs are answered, violence and cruelty are dealt with, and [God](glossary.md#god)’s people are protected. The book ends with an image of [God](glossary.md#god)’s presence bringing life, like a source of water that makes dry places flourish.

**Big idea:** Joel uses a crisis as a warning, but also offers hope that change and rebuilding are possible.

## Big ideas

* Crisis is treated as a wake-up call for a whole community, not only individuals.
* The book mixes warning with hope: change and rebuilding are still possible.
* A promise about [God](glossary.md#god)’s Spirit becomes important later in Christian reading of Acts.
