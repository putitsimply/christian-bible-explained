# Gospels

The Gospels are four books that tell the story of Jesus’ life and teaching. They overlap in many ways, but each has a different style and focus.

“Gospel[^gl_gospel]” means “good news”. In this guide, the summaries describe what each Gospel says and what themes it emphasises.

## Books in this section

* [Matthew](matthew.md): links Jesus’ story to Old Testament themes and promises.
* [Mark](mark.md): fast-moving, focused on actions and the meaning of Jesus’ mission.
* [Luke](luke.md): highlights outsiders, compassion, and a careful story structure.
* [John](john.md): reflective and symbolic, focusing on who Jesus is.

[^gl_gospel]: “Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life. ([Glossary](glossary.md#gospel))
