# Jeremiah

## What this book is

Jeremiah is a long book about a <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a> named Jeremiah, who lives in <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> (the southern kingdom, where <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> is). <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> tells Jeremiah to warn the people and their leaders that they are heading for disaster because they have turned away from <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>, treated others unfairly, and trusted in things like political deals, money, and even the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">Temple</a> building itself as if it were a “good luck charm.”

## What it contains

### What Jeremiah keeps warning about

Jeremiah’s main message is blunt: if <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> keeps going this way, Babylon will conquer them, <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> will fall, and many people will be taken away from their land (this is called <a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a>). Jeremiah says the problem is not just “breaking rules” but deep unfaithfulness, like breaking a relationship. He uses strong pictures and stories to make the point, and people often hate him for it.

### Jeremiah’s life is hard

Jeremiah is mocked, threatened, and even attacked. At times he complains to <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> because he feels lonely and overwhelmed, but he keeps speaking anyway. He also acts out symbolic “object lessons” to get attention, like wearing a yoke to show that Babylon’s power is coming and <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> should stop pretending it can’t happen. He argues against “false <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</a>” who claim everything will be fine.

### The fall of <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>

Eventually, what Jeremiah warned about happens. Babylon’s armies defeat <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a>, <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> is destroyed, and many people are deported. Jeremiah is still in the middle of it all, advising kings, being imprisoned at points, and watching the collapse he predicted.

### Hope in the middle of judgment

Even though Jeremiah is full of warnings, it is also full of hope. Jeremiah says the <a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a> will not be the end of the story. He promises that the people will return one day, and that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> still wants a real relationship with them, not fake religion.

One of the biggest hope sections is about a **new <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</a>**. A <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</a> is a serious promise-based relationship. Jeremiah says that instead of the law just being something written on stone or paper, <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> will “write it on their hearts,” meaning people will be changed on the inside, not just pressured to behave on the outside.

### How the book ends

After <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> falls, some survivors flee to Egypt, and Jeremiah ends up going with them, still warning them not to repeat the same mistakes. The book finishes with a mix of sadness, lessons from the disaster, and promises that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s story with the people is not finished.

## Big ideas

* The book links injustice and false confidence with national disaster.
* It shows a <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a>’s lonely, risky role: speaking an unpopular message.
* Hope appears through the idea of a “new <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</a>” (a renewed relationship and changed hearts).
