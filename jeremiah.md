# Jeremiah

## What this book is

Jeremiah is a long book about a [prophet[^gl_prophet]](glossary.md#prophet) named Jeremiah, who lives in [Judah[^gl_judah]](glossary.md#judah) (the southern kingdom, where [Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]](glossary.md#jerusalem) is). [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) tells Jeremiah to warn the people and their leaders that they are heading for disaster because they have turned away from [God](glossary.md#god), treated others unfairly, and trusted in things like political deals, money, and even the [Temple[^gl_temple]](glossary.md#temple) building itself as if it were a “good luck charm.”

## What it contains

### What Jeremiah keeps warning about

Jeremiah’s main message is blunt: if [Judah](glossary.md#judah) keeps going this way, Babylon will conquer them, [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem) will fall, and many people will be taken away from their land (this is called [exile[^gl_exile]](glossary.md#exile)). Jeremiah says the problem is not just “breaking rules” but deep unfaithfulness, like breaking a relationship. He uses strong pictures and stories to make the point, and people often hate him for it.

### Jeremiah’s life is hard

Jeremiah is mocked, threatened, and even attacked. At times he complains to [God](glossary.md#god) because he feels lonely and overwhelmed, but he keeps speaking anyway. He also acts out symbolic “object lessons” to get attention, like wearing a yoke to show that Babylon’s power is coming and [Judah](glossary.md#judah) should stop pretending it can’t happen. He argues against “false [prophets](glossary.md#prophet)” who claim everything will be fine.

### The fall of [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem)

Eventually, what Jeremiah warned about happens. Babylon’s armies defeat [Judah](glossary.md#judah), [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem) is destroyed, and many people are deported. Jeremiah is still in the middle of it all, advising kings, being imprisoned at points, and watching the collapse he predicted.

### Hope in the middle of judgment

Even though Jeremiah is full of warnings, it is also full of hope. Jeremiah says the [exile](glossary.md#exile) will not be the end of the story. He promises that the people will return one day, and that [God](glossary.md#god) still wants a real relationship with them, not fake religion.

One of the biggest hope sections is about a **new [covenant[^gl_covenant]](glossary.md#covenant)**. A [covenant](glossary.md#covenant) is a serious promise-based relationship. Jeremiah says that instead of the law just being something written on stone or paper, [God](glossary.md#god) will “write it on their hearts,” meaning people will be changed on the inside, not just pressured to behave on the outside.

### How the book ends

After [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem) falls, some survivors flee to Egypt, and Jeremiah ends up going with them, still warning them not to repeat the same mistakes. The book finishes with a mix of sadness, lessons from the disaster, and promises that [God](glossary.md#god)’s story with the people is not finished.

## Big ideas

* The book links injustice and false confidence with national disaster.
* It shows a [prophet](glossary.md#prophet)’s lonely, risky role: speaking an unpopular message.
* Hope appears through the idea of a “new [covenant](glossary.md#covenant)” (a renewed relationship and changed hearts).
