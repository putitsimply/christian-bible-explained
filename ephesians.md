# Ephesians

## What this book is

Ephesians is a letter in the New Testament. It is traditionally linked to the [apostle[^gl_apostle]](glossary.md#apostle) Paul and is written to help Christians understand who they are as a community and how they should live.

## What it contains

**1) [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s plan and kindness (chapters 1 to 3)**

* The writer starts by praising [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) and saying [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) has a bigger plan to bring people together through Jesus.
* A key word is **[grace[^gl_grace]](glossary.md#grace)**, which means [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s gift of kindness that people do not earn. The letter says people are “saved” by [grace[^gl_grace]](glossary.md#grace) through [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith). **Saved** here means rescued and brought into a right relationship with [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god), not because of good deeds, but because of [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s gift.
* It also talks about the **[Holy Spirit[^gl_holy_spirit]](glossary.md#holy-spirit)**, described as [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s presence and help with believers.
* One important theme is unity between different groups, especially Jewish and non Jewish people. The letter says Jesus breaks down the “walls” that kept people apart and creates one united community.
* The writer uses the idea of the **[church[^gl_church]](glossary.md#church)** as a “body.” Here, [church[^gl_church]](glossary.md#church) does not just mean a building, it means the community of believers, meant to work together like parts of one body.
**2) How to live as this new community (chapters 4 to 6)**

* The letter shifts from beliefs to behaviour. It urges people to live in a way that matches their new identity: be humble, patient, honest, kind, and forgiving.
* It contrasts an “old self” and a “new self,” meaning old habits and attitudes should be replaced with better ones.
* It talks about using words to build others up, not tear them down.
* It describes different roles and gifts in the community, saying they are meant to help everyone grow in maturity.
* It includes advice for households in the ancient world (relationships between spouses, parents and children, and masters and servants). The overall direction is to act with love, respect, and responsibility, even though people today may read these parts carefully because society and laws have changed a lot since then.
* Near the end, it uses the famous picture of the **armour of [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)**. This is a metaphor, not literal armour. It means being ready to stand firm in hard times using truth, justice, peace, [faith[^gl_faith]](glossary.md#faith), and a strong focus on what is right.
* The letter finishes with encouragement to pray and keep going.

## Big ideas

* Ephesians says that [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) brings people into a new family through Jesus, and this should change how they treat each other and how they live day to day.
* The letter stresses unity across differences (especially Jewish and non-Jewish believers).
* In one sentence: [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s [grace[^gl_grace]](glossary.md#grace) creates a united community, and that community is called to live with love, maturity, and courage.
