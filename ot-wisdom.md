# Poetry and wisdom

These books are mostly poems, songs, and thoughtful reflections. They focus on feelings, life skills, and big questions about suffering, fairness, and meaning.

Because they use poetry and sayings, they often speak in images and patterns rather than straightforward stories.

## Books in this section

* [Job](job.md): suffering and the question, “Is life always fair?”
* [Psalms](psalms.md): songs and prayers[^gl_prayer] for many emotions and situations.
* [Proverbs](proverbs.md): short sayings about wise living.
* [Ecclesiastes](ecclesiastes.md): reflections on meaning, time, and what lasts.
* [Song of Solomon](song-of-solomon.md): love poetry.

[^gl_prayer]: Speaking to God (silently or aloud). ([Glossary](glossary.md#prayer))
