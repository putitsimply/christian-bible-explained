# Exodus

## What this book is

Exodus is the second book of the Christian [Bible[^gl_bible]](glossary.md#bible). It tells how the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) (a people group descended from Jacob’s family in Genesis) go from being slaves in Egypt to becoming a community with their own laws and a special agreement with [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god).

## What it contains

The story starts with the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) living in Egypt. Over time, a new Egyptian king (often called “Pharaoh”) becomes afraid they are growing too numerous, so he forces them into harsh slavery. A baby boy named Moses is born during a time when Hebrew baby boys are being killed. Moses survives and is raised in Pharaoh’s household, but later he flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was hurting a Hebrew slave.

Years later, Moses has a famous encounter with [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) at a burning bush. [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) sends Moses back to Egypt to demand that Pharaoh let the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) go free. Moses’ brother Aaron helps him speak to Pharaoh. Pharaoh refuses, and a series of disasters strike Egypt, usually called the ten plagues (like water turning to blood, locusts, darkness, and more). The final plague is the death of the firstborn, and the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) are told to mark their doorframes with lamb’s blood so the danger “passes over” them. This event becomes the basis of the festival called [Passover[^gl_passover]](glossary.md#passover).

After that, Pharaoh finally lets the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) leave. Soon he changes his mind and chases them with his army. The [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) escape through the Red Sea (the story describes the waters parting), and Pharaoh’s army is destroyed when the waters return.

In the middle of the book, the [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) travel through the wilderness toward Mount Sinai. They face hunger and thirst, and the story describes [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) providing food (manna and quail) and water.

At Mount Sinai, Moses receives the Ten Commandments and many other laws. These laws cover [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship), justice, family life, and how to treat others fairly, especially vulnerable people. The [Israelites[^gl_israel]](glossary.md#israel) make a [covenant[^gl_covenant]](glossary.md#covenant), which means a serious promise or agreement, to live by these instructions.

Near the end, there’s a major failure: while Moses is on the mountain, some people make and [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) a golden calf. Moses confronts this, and the [covenant[^gl_covenant]](glossary.md#covenant) is renewed.

Finally, [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) gives detailed instructions for building the [tabernacle[^gl_tabernacle]](glossary.md#tabernacle), a portable [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship) tent. The book ends with the [tabernacle[^gl_tabernacle]](glossary.md#tabernacle) being set up and [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god)’s presence shown as a cloud filling it, suggesting that [God[^gl_god]](glossary.md#god) will travel with the people.

## Big ideas

* Freedom and identity: the story moves from slavery to becoming a community with shared laws and practices.
* [Covenant[^gl_covenant]](glossary.md#covenant): the book centres on a serious agreement about how to live and [worship[^gl_worship]](glossary.md#worship).
* Trust under pressure: fear, hunger, and conflict keep testing the people on the journey.
