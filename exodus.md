# Exodus

## What this book is

Exodus is the second book of the Christian Bible[^gl-bible]. It tells how the Israelites[^gl-israel] (a people group descended from Jacob’s family in Genesis) go from being slaves in Egypt to becoming a community with their own laws and a special agreement with God[^gl-god].

## What it contains

The story starts with the Israelites[^gl-israel] living in Egypt. Over time, a new Egyptian king (often called “Pharaoh”) becomes afraid they are growing too numerous, so he forces them into harsh slavery. A baby boy named Moses is born during a time when Hebrew baby boys are being killed. Moses survives and is raised in Pharaoh’s household, but later he flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was hurting a Hebrew slave.

Years later, Moses has a famous encounter with God[^gl-god] at a burning bush. God[^gl-god] sends Moses back to Egypt to demand that Pharaoh let the Israelites[^gl-israel] go free. Moses’ brother Aaron helps him speak to Pharaoh. Pharaoh refuses, and a series of disasters strike Egypt, usually called the ten plagues (like water turning to blood, locusts, darkness, and more). The final plague is the death of the firstborn, and the Israelites[^gl-israel] are told to mark their doorframes with lamb’s blood so the danger “passes over” them. This event becomes the basis of the festival called Passover[^gl-passover].

After that, Pharaoh finally lets the Israelites[^gl-israel] leave. Soon he changes his mind and chases them with his army. The Israelites[^gl-israel] escape through the Red Sea (the story describes the waters parting), and Pharaoh’s army is destroyed when the waters return.

In the middle of the book, the Israelites[^gl-israel] travel through the wilderness toward Mount Sinai. They face hunger and thirst, and the story describes God[^gl-god] providing food (manna and quail) and water.

At Mount Sinai, Moses receives the Ten Commandments and many other laws. These laws cover worship[^gl-worship], justice, family life, and how to treat others fairly, especially vulnerable people. The Israelites[^gl-israel] make a covenant[^gl-covenant], which means a serious promise or agreement, to live by these instructions.

Near the end, there’s a major failure: while Moses is on the mountain, some people make and worship[^gl-worship] a golden calf. Moses confronts this, and the covenant[^gl-covenant] is renewed.

Finally, God[^gl-god] gives detailed instructions for building the tabernacle[^gl-tabernacle], a portable worship[^gl-worship] tent. The book ends with the tabernacle[^gl-tabernacle] being set up and God[^gl-god]’s presence shown as a cloud filling it, suggesting that God[^gl-god] will travel with the people.

## Big ideas

* Freedom and identity: the story moves from slavery to becoming a community with shared laws and practices.
* Covenant[^gl-covenant]: the book centres on a serious agreement about how to live and worship[^gl-worship].
* Trust under pressure: fear, hunger, and conflict keep testing the people on the journey.
