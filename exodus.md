# Exodus

## What this book is

Exodus is the second book of the Christian <a href="glossary.md#bible" title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</a>. It tells how the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> (a people group descended from Jacob’s family in Genesis) go from being slaves in Egypt to becoming a community with their own laws and a special agreement with <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>.

## What it contains

The story starts with the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> living in Egypt. Over time, a new Egyptian king (often called “Pharaoh”) becomes afraid they are growing too numerous, so he forces them into harsh slavery. A baby boy named Moses is born during a time when Hebrew baby boys are being killed. Moses survives and is raised in Pharaoh’s household, but later he flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was hurting a Hebrew slave.

Years later, Moses has a famous encounter with <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> at a burning bush. <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> sends Moses back to Egypt to demand that Pharaoh let the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> go free. Moses’ brother Aaron helps him speak to Pharaoh. Pharaoh refuses, and a series of disasters strike Egypt, usually called the ten plagues (like water turning to blood, locusts, darkness, and more). The final plague is the death of the firstborn, and the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> are told to mark their doorframes with lamb’s blood so the danger “passes over” them. This event becomes the basis of the festival called <a href="glossary.md#passover" title="A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.">Passover</a>.

After that, Pharaoh finally lets the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> leave. Soon he changes his mind and chases them with his army. The <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> escape through the Red Sea (the story describes the waters parting), and Pharaoh’s army is destroyed when the waters return.

In the middle of the book, the <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> travel through the wilderness toward Mount Sinai. They face hunger and thirst, and the story describes <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> providing food (manna and quail) and water.

At Mount Sinai, Moses receives the Ten Commandments and many other laws. These laws cover <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>, justice, family life, and how to treat others fairly, especially vulnerable people. The <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> make a <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</a>, which means a serious promise or agreement, to live by these instructions.

Near the end, there’s a major failure: while Moses is on the mountain, some people make and <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> a golden calf. Moses confronts this, and the <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</a> is renewed.

Finally, <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> gives detailed instructions for building the <a href="glossary.md#tabernacle" title="A portable worship tent used by the Israelites.">tabernacle</a>, a portable <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> tent. The book ends with the <a href="glossary.md#tabernacle" title="A portable worship tent used by the Israelites.">tabernacle</a> being set up and <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s presence shown as a cloud filling it, suggesting that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> will travel with the people.

## Big ideas

* Freedom and identity: the story moves from slavery to becoming a community with shared laws and practices.
* <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">Covenant</a>: the book centres on a serious agreement about how to live and <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>.
* Trust under pressure: fear, hunger, and conflict keep testing the people on the journey.
