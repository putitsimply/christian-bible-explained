# Major prophets

The prophets are writings that contain speeches, poems, stories, and visions. Prophets[^gl_prophet] challenge leaders and communities about things like worship[^gl_worship], justice, and caring for the vulnerable.

“Major” means these books are longer, not that they are more important.

* [Jeremiah](jeremiah.md): hard messages before Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] falls, plus hope after.
