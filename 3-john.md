# 3 John

## What this book is

3 John is one of the shortest books in the Christian Bible[^gl-bible]. It is a short letter, written by someone who calls himself “the elder,” which means an older leader in the Christian community. Many Christians have traditionally linked this writer with John, a major early Christian leader, but the letter itself does not fully explain who he is.

## What it contains

### What happens in the letter

**1) A warm message to a man named Gaius**
The writer addresses the letter to **Gaius**, who seems to be a respected member of a local church[^gl-church]. He says he is happy because he hears that Gaius is “walking in the truth.” In simple terms, that means Gaius is living in a way that matches what he believes about God[^gl-god] and Jesus, not just talking about it.

**2) Praise for helping travelling Christian workers**
A big focus of the letter is **hospitality**, which means welcoming and caring for guests. In the early church[^gl-church], teachers and messengers often travelled between towns. They needed food, a safe place to stay, and help with travel costs.

The writer praises Gaius for supporting these visitors, especially those who are working to spread Christian teaching. He says that when people help them, they become “co-workers” in the mission, even if they are not the ones travelling.

**3) A problem leader named Diotrephes**\
Then the letter shifts to a conflict. The writer warns about a man named **Diotrephes**, who appears to have influence in the church[^gl-church] but behaves badly. Diotrephes does not welcome the travelling workers, and he also refuses to accept the writer’s authority. Worse, he tries to stop others from helping the visitors, and he even pushes people out of the church[^gl-church] who do help.

The writer is basically saying, “This is not how a good leader behaves.”

**4) A role model named Demetrius**
Next, the writer points to **Demetrius** as a good example. Demetrius has a strong reputation, and others speak well of him. This may be because Demetrius is one of the travellers, or someone connected to them.

**5) A promise to visit**
Finally, the writer says he has more to say but prefers to do it face-to-face. He hopes to visit soon, rather than sending a longer letter.

## Big ideas

* **Truth should shape behaviour**, not just beliefs.
* **Helping others who do good work matters**, especially when they are vulnerable or far from home.
* **Leadership should be humble and fair**, not controlling or selfish.
* **Choose good examples to follow**, not people who misuse power.
