# Minor prophets

These are twelve shorter prophetic books. Prophets[^gl_prophet] speak messages they believe come from God[^gl_god]. These books speak to different places and times, but many return to similar themes: worship[^gl_worship], justice, faithfulness, and hope after disaster.

“Minor” means shorter, not less meaningful.

## Books in this section

* [Hosea](hosea.md): faithfulness, pictured through a difficult family story.
* [Joel](joel.md): disaster as a wake-up call, with hope for renewal.
* [Amos](amos.md): strong focus on justice and care for the poor.
* [Obadiah](obadiah.md): a short message about conflict between neighbouring peoples.
* [Jonah](jonah.md): a story about mercy, enemies, and changing your mind.
* [Micah](micah.md): justice now, and hope for peace later.
