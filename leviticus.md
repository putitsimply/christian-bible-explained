# Leviticus

## What this book is

Leviticus is the third book of the [Bible](glossary.md#bible) [^gl-bible]. It picks up straight after Exodus, when the [Israelites](glossary.md#israel) [^gl-israel] are camped near Mount Sinai and have built the special [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] tent called the [tabernacle](glossary.md#tabernacle) [^gl-tabernacle] (a portable “meeting place” with [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god]).

Most of Leviticus is not a story with lots of action. It is mainly a set of instructions. These instructions are meant to teach the [Israelites](glossary.md#israel) [^gl-israel] how to [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship], how to live as a community, and how to stay “holy,” meaning set apart for [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god] in the way they behave.

## What it contains

Here’s what happens, in a clear overview:

* **Rules for offerings and sacrifices (Leviticus 1 to 7):** [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god] gives Moses instructions for different kinds of offerings. Some are about saying sorry for wrongdoing, some are about thankfulness, and some are about showing devotion. The idea is that [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] is serious and needs care, not shortcuts.
* **[Priests](glossary.md#priest) [^gl-priest] begin their work (Leviticus 8 to 10):** Moses sets apart Aaron (Moses’ brother) and Aaron’s sons as [priests](glossary.md#priest) [^gl-priest], meaning their job is to lead [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] and help the people follow these rules. A dramatic moment happens when two of Aaron’s sons disobey the [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] instructions, and they die. The message is that the [priest](glossary.md#priest) [^gl-priest] role is not casual.
* **Clean and unclean (Leviticus 11 to 15):** The book explains many “clean” and “unclean” rules. These include food laws, health issues, and bodily conditions. “Unclean” here usually does not mean “dirty” in a modern insult sense. It means someone cannot take part in [worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] for a time, often for safety, health, or symbolic reasons.
* **The Day of [Atonement](glossary.md#atonement) [^gl-atonement] (Leviticus 16):** This is a major yearly ceremony. “[Atonement](glossary.md#atonement) [^gl-atonement]” means making things right after wrongdoing. The [high priest](glossary.md#high-priest) [^gl-high-priest] performs special rituals asking for forgiveness for the whole community.
* **How to live a holy life (Leviticus 17 to 27):** These chapters include rules about justice, honesty, kindness to the poor, sexual behaviour, and not copying harmful practices from surrounding nations. It also includes special festivals and rest days, including the [Sabbath](glossary.md#sabbath) [^gl-sabbath] and a “Jubilee” system where land and debts were meant to be reset over time.

## Big ideas

* [Worship](glossary.md#worship) [^gl-worship] is treated as serious and careful, not casual.
* Community life matters: the rules include justice, honesty, and protection for vulnerable people.
* Holiness is about everyday behaviour, not only religious ceremonies.
