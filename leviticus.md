# Leviticus

## What this book is

Leviticus is the third book of the Bible[^gl_bible]. It picks up straight after Exodus, when the Israelites[^gl_israel] are camped near Mount Sinai and have built the special worship[^gl_worship] tent called the tabernacle[^gl_tabernacle] (a portable “meeting place” with God[^gl_god]).

Most of Leviticus is not a story with lots of action. It is mainly a set of instructions. These instructions are meant to teach the Israelites how to worship, how to live as a community, and how to stay “holy,” meaning set apart for God in the way they behave.

Some rules can feel strange today, but in the ancient world they helped shape identity (who this community is), safety (like health rules), and fairness (like protecting poor people and workers). Readers today often focus on the big themes of worship, responsibility, and justice.

## What it contains

Here’s what happens, in a clear overview:

* **Rules for offerings and sacrifices[^gl_sacrifice] (Leviticus 1 to 7):** God gives Moses instructions for different kinds of offerings. Some are about saying sorry for wrongdoing, some are about thankfulness, and some are about showing devotion. The idea is that worship is serious and needs care, not shortcuts.
* **Priests[^gl_priest] begin their work (Leviticus 8 to 10):** Moses sets apart Aaron (Moses’ brother) and Aaron’s sons as priests, meaning their job is to lead worship and help the people follow these rules. A dramatic moment happens when two of Aaron’s sons disobey the worship instructions, and they die. The message is that the priest role is not casual.
* **Clean and unclean (Leviticus 11 to 15):** The book explains many “clean” and “unclean” rules. These include food laws, health issues, and bodily conditions. “Unclean” here usually does not mean “dirty” in a modern insult sense. It means someone cannot take part in worship for a time, often for safety, health, or symbolic reasons.
* **The Day of Atonement[^gl_atonement] (Leviticus 16):** This is a major yearly ceremony. “Atonement” means making things right after wrongdoing. The high priest[^gl_high_priest] performs special rituals asking for forgiveness for the whole community.
* **How to live a holy life (Leviticus 17 to 27):** These chapters include rules about justice, honesty, kindness to the poor, sexual behaviour, and not copying harmful practices from surrounding nations. It also includes special festivals and rest days, including the Sabbath[^gl_sabbath] and a “Jubilee” system where land and debts were meant to be reset over time.

## Big ideas

* Worship is treated as serious and careful, not casual.
* Community life matters: the rules include justice, honesty, and protection for vulnerable people.
* Holiness is about everyday behaviour, not only religious ceremonies.

Leviticus has had a long influence. Later Jewish practice and later Christian teaching often look back to its ideas about sacrifice, forgiveness, and what it means to live differently from surrounding cultures.
