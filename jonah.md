# Jonah

## What this book is

Jonah is a short story about a [prophet](glossary.md#prophet)[^gl-prophet] (a messenger who says they are speaking for [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]) who gets told to do something he really does not want to do.

## What it contains

Jonah is told to go to the big city of **Nineveh** and warn the people there that their wrongdoing is going to bring judgment. Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, which [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel] feared. So Jonah does not just feel nervous, he feels angry at the idea that Nineveh might get a chance to change.

Instead of going to Nineveh, Jonah runs the other way and boards a ship heading far from where he is meant to go. A huge storm hits, and the sailors panic. They pray to their own gods. Jonah admits he is running away from [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s command. The sailors do not want to hurt him, but the storm will not stop, so Jonah tells them to throw him into the sea. When they do, the storm calms immediately, and the sailors become deeply respectful of Jonah’s [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god].

Jonah does not drown. He is swallowed by a “great fish” (the story does not name the animal). Inside the fish, Jonah prays. His [prayer](glossary.md#prayer)[^gl-prayer] sounds like someone who has hit rock bottom, then remembers that they can still ask for help. After three days, the fish vomits Jonah onto dry land.

Jonah is told again to go to Nineveh, and this time he goes. His message is simple and direct: Nineveh is headed for disaster unless things change. Surprisingly, the people take it seriously. They stop, feel sorry for what they have done, and show it publicly by fasting. Even the king joins in and orders the whole city to turn away from violence and wrongdoing.

Because of this change, [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] does not destroy the city. Jonah is furious. He wanted punishment, not mercy. He complains that this is exactly why he ran away in the first place, because he knew [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] might forgive them.

The final scene is like a lesson acted out. Jonah sits outside the city, hoping to see it destroyed. A plant grows to give him shade, and Jonah is happy. Then the plant withers, and Jonah is upset again. [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] uses the plant to make a point: Jonah cared about a plant he did not grow and did not work for, so should he not care about a whole city full of people, including many who do not really understand right from wrong yet?

The book ends with that question hanging in the air. The big idea is about **mercy**, and how hard it can be to accept mercy for enemies.

## Big ideas

* Mercy is central: the story challenges Jonah’s anger about forgiveness for enemies.
