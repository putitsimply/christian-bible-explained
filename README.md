# [Bible](glossary.md#bible) overview (student guide)

The [Bible](glossary.md#bible) is a collection of many different writings that were gathered over a long period of time. It includes stories, laws, poems, prayers, wise sayings, letters, and a book full of symbols and visions. Christians treat the [Bible](glossary.md#bible) as sacred [scripture](glossary.md#scripture), and many parts of it are also important in Judaism.

This guide gives short, neutral summaries of each [Bible](glossary.md#bible) book. It aims to describe what the books contain and why they matter in history and culture, without asking readers to agree with any religious belief.

If a word is unfamiliar, the [Glossary (helpful words)](glossary.md) explains common terms in simple language.

The Christian [Bible](glossary.md#bible) is usually divided into two big parts:

* **Old Testament**: writings from ancient [Israel](glossary.md#israel), including stories of origins and nationhood, laws, [worship](glossary.md#worship) songs, wisdom writings, and messages from [prophets](glossary.md#prophet).
* **New Testament**: writings from the first century that focus on Jesus and the early Christian movement, including biographies (the Gospels), a history book (Acts), letters to churches and leaders, and Revelation.
Different Christian traditions order the books differently, and some include extra books that are not in every [Bible](glossary.md#bible). This guide follows the 66-book ordering that is common in Protestant Bibles.
