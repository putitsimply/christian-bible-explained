It includes stories, laws, poems, prayers, wise sayings, letters, and a book full of symbols and visions.

The Christian <a href="glossary.md#bible"><span title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</span></a> is usually divided into two big parts:

* **Old Testament**: writings from ancient <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>, including stories of origins and nationhood, laws, <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> songs, wisdom writings, and messages from <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</span></a>.
* **New Testament**: writings from the first century that focus on Jesus and the early Christian movement, including biographies (the <a href="glossary.md#gospel"><span title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospels</span></a>), a history book (Acts), letters to churches and leaders, and Revelation.
Different Christian traditions order the books differently, and some include extra books that are not in every <a href="glossary.md#bible"><span title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</span></a>. This guide follows the 66-book ordering that is common in Protestant Bibles.
