# Bible[^gl_bible] overview (student guide)

The Bible is a collection of many different writings that were gathered over a long period of time. It includes stories, laws, poems, prayers[^gl_prayer], wise sayings, letters, and a book full of symbols and visions. Christians treat the Bible as sacred scripture[^gl_scripture], and many parts of it are also important in Judaism.

This guide gives short, neutral summaries of each Bible book. It aims to describe what the books contain and why they matter in history and culture, without asking readers to agree with any religious belief.

If a word is unfamiliar, the [Glossary (helpful words)](glossary.md) explains common terms in simple language.

## How to use this guide

* Start with the Testament overviews to see the “big picture” story and the main types of books.
* When you read a book summary, look for:
  * **What kind of writing it is** (story, law, poetry, letter, or symbolic vision).
  * **Who is speaking and who is listening** (for example, a prophet[^gl_prophet] addressing a nation, or a letter to a church[^gl_church]).
  * **The main theme**, such as justice, wisdom, worship[^gl_worship], or hope.
* Book summaries aim to stay within 500 words for the main text (the tooltip-style footnote definition block at the end is not part of that count).
* Remember that the Bible contains religious beliefs. In this guide, wording is kept descriptive (for example, “the text says…” or “Christians believe…”) so it can be used by students from different backgrounds.

The Christian Bible is usually divided into two big parts:

* **Old Testament**: writings from ancient Israel[^gl_israel], including stories of origins and nationhood, laws, worship[^gl_worship] songs, wisdom writings, and messages from prophets[^gl_prophet].
* **New Testament**: writings from the first century that focus on Jesus and the early Christian movement, including biographies (the Gospels[^gl_gospel]), a history book (Acts), letters to churches and leaders, and Revelation.
Different Christian traditions order the books differently, and some include extra books that are not in every Bible. This guide follows the 66-book ordering that is common in Protestant Bibles.
