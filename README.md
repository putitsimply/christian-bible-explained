# Bible[^gl-bible] overview (student guide)

The Bible[^gl-bible] is a collection of many different writings that were gathered over a long period of time. It includes stories, laws, poems, prayers, wise sayings, letters, and a book full of symbols and visions. Christians treat the Bible[^gl-bible] as sacred scripture[^gl-scripture], and many parts of it are also important in Judaism.

This guide gives short, neutral summaries of each Bible[^gl-bible] book. It aims to describe what the books contain and why they matter in history and culture, without asking readers to agree with any religious belief.

If a word is unfamiliar, the [Glossary (helpful words)](glossary.md) explains common terms in simple language.

The Christian Bible[^gl-bible] is usually divided into two big parts:

* **Old Testament**: writings from ancient Israel[^gl-israel], including stories of origins and nationhood, laws, worship[^gl-worship] songs, wisdom writings, and messages from prophets[^gl-prophet].
* **New Testament**: writings from the first century that focus on Jesus and the early Christian movement, including biographies (the Gospels), a history book (Acts), letters to churches and leaders, and Revelation.

Different Christian traditions order the books differently, and some include extra books that are not in every Bible[^gl-bible]. This guide follows the 66-book ordering that is common in Protestant Bibles.
