# [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.") overview (student guide)

The [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.") is a collection of many different writings that were gathered over a long period of time. It includes stories, laws, poems, prayers, wise sayings, letters, and a book full of symbols and visions. Christians treat the [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.") as sacred [scripture](glossary.md#scripture "Sacred writings (often the Bible)."), and many parts of it are also important in Judaism.

This guide gives short, neutral summaries of each [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.") book. It aims to describe what the books contain and why they matter in history and culture, without asking readers to agree with any religious belief.

If a word is unfamiliar, the [Glossary (helpful words)](glossary.md) explains common terms in simple language.

The Christian [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.") is usually divided into two big parts:

* **Old Testament**: writings from ancient [Israel](glossary.md#israel "Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people."), including stories of origins and nationhood, laws, [worship](glossary.md#worship "Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).") songs, wisdom writings, and messages from [prophets](glossary.md#prophet "A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.").
* **New Testament**: writings from the first century that focus on Jesus and the early Christian movement, including biographies (the [Gospels](glossary.md#gospel "“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.")), a history book (Acts), letters to churches and leaders, and Revelation.
Different Christian traditions order the books differently, and some include extra books that are not in every [Bible](glossary.md#bible "Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing."). This guide follows the 66-book ordering that is common in Protestant Bibles.
