# Mark

## What this book is

The <a href="glossary.md#gospel" title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospel</a> of Mark is a story about Jesus’ life, told in a fast, action-focused way. It spends less time on long speeches and more time showing what Jesus does and how people react to him.

## What it contains

**How it starts**

Mark opens with John the Baptist preparing people for someone important. Jesus is baptised, then goes into the wilderness for a time of testing. After that, Jesus begins travelling around Galilee, teaching and calling followers, who are called **<a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a>** (students who learn from a teacher and follow their way of life).

**Jesus’ ministry**

A big part of Mark shows Jesus doing powerful actions that people in the story see as signs of <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s power. These include healing sick people, helping people who are suffering, calming a storm, and feeding large crowds. Jesus also tells short teaching stories called **<a href="glossary.md#parable" title="A short teaching story.">parables</a>** (stories with a deeper meaning). He talks a lot about the “kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>”, which in this context means <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s rule or reign, the idea that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is at work to set things right.

**Questions about who Jesus is**

People keep trying to figure out Jesus’ identity. Some think he is a <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a> or a teacher. Others start to believe he is the **<a href="glossary.md#messiah" title="“Anointed one”; a chosen leader. Christians apply it to Jesus.">Messiah</a>** (a word that means “anointed one”, a promised leader in Jewish hope). In Mark, even Jesus’ closest followers often misunderstand him or get scared when things get hard. Mark shows them learning slowly, with plenty of mistakes along the way.

**Conflict grows**

Jesus argues with some religious leaders, especially about rules, authority, and what really matters to <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>, like mercy and justice. As Jesus becomes more well known, the tension increases.

**Journey to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> and the final week**

In the second half of Mark, Jesus heads to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>. He predicts his suffering and death, and teaches that following him can involve <a href="glossary.md#sacrifice" title="An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).">sacrifice</a>. In <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>, there is a last meal with his <a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a>, betrayal, arrest, and a trial. Jesus is crucified (executed on a cross by the Romans). Mark describes his suffering in a serious, direct way.

**The ending**

After Jesus dies, he is buried. Then, on the third day, women go to the tomb and find it empty. They are told that Jesus has been raised from the dead (which Christians believe happened), and that his followers should go on to Galilee. Some Bibles include extra verses after this point, because ancient manuscripts end Mark in more than one way.

Overall, Mark is a fast-moving account that highlights Jesus’ actions, the growing conflict around him, and the challenge of understanding what kind of leader he is.

## Big ideas

* Mark moves quickly to show what Jesus does and how people respond.
* The story keeps asking “Who is Jesus?” and shows even close followers struggling to understand.
* Conflict grows into arrest, <a href="glossary.md#crucifixion" title="Roman execution on a cross.">crucifixion</a>, and (in Christian belief) <a href="glossary.md#resurrection" title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</a>.
