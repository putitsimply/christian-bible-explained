# New Testament

The New Testament is the second big section of the Christian [Bible](glossary.md#bible) [^gl-bible]. It is a collection of 27 books written in the first century, in the world of the Roman Empire. These books focus on Jesus and on the early Christian communities that formed after him.

It begins with four books called the **[Gospels](glossary.md#gospel) [^gl-gospel]**. “[Gospel](glossary.md#gospel)” means “good news.” Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John tell the story of Jesus’ life and teaching, his death by [crucifixion](glossary.md#crucifixion) [^gl-crucifixion], and (according to Christian belief) his [resurrection](glossary.md#resurrection) [^gl-resurrection]. They overlap in many ways, but each has its own focus and style.

Next is **Acts**, which describes how Jesus’ followers spread their message, formed communities (often called churches), and dealt with disagreements and challenges. A major figure in Acts is **Paul**, a travelling teacher who becomes a key leader in early Christianity.

After Acts come many **letters** (also called “[epistles](glossary.md#epistle) [^gl-epistle]”). Some are written by Paul, and others by different Christian leaders. These letters are like real messages to real communities. They explain beliefs, answer questions, encourage people, and give advice about living well, handling conflict, and caring for others.

The New Testament ends with **Revelation**, a book full of powerful images and symbols. It was written to encourage Christians facing fear and pressure. Different readers interpret its symbols in different ways, but it is strongly focused on hope, justice, and the idea that evil will not last forever.

Overall, the New Testament is about who Jesus is (in Christian belief, the promised [Messiah](glossary.md#messiah) [^gl-messiah]) and what it means to live as his followers in everyday life.
