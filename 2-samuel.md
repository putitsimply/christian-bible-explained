*Where this book fits:* [Old Testament](old-testament.md) → [History (Old Testament)](ot-history.md)

## What this book is

**2 Samuel** continues the story of David and shows both his best moments as a leader and his worst moral failures.

## What it contains

After King Saul dies, David is made king of the tribe of Judah[^gl_judah], ruling from Hebron. At the same time, Saul’s son Ish-bosheth is made king over the other tribes of Israel[^gl_israel]. There is a long conflict between the two sides, and over time David grows stronger. When Ish-bosheth is killed, the tribes of Israel come together and anoint David as king over all Israel.

David then captures the city of Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] and makes it his capital. He also brings the Ark of the Covenant[^gl_covenant] to Jerusalem. The Ark was a sacred chest that represented God[^gl_god]’s presence and Israel’s covenant, meaning a special agreement, with God.

One of the most important parts of the book is God’s promise to David that his royal family line will continue, and that his kingdom will be established in a lasting way. This promise becomes a major idea later in the Bible[^gl_bible], especially in how Christians think about Jesus.

David wins many battles and becomes famous, but then the story takes a dark turn. David commits adultery with Bathsheba, who is married to Uriah. When Bathsheba becomes pregnant, David tries to cover it up and arranges for Uriah to be killed in battle. A prophet[^gl_prophet] named Nathan confronts David, and David admits he has done wrong. David is forgiven, but the book shows that his actions still bring painful consequences for his family.

Trouble grows inside David’s household. One of David’s sons, Amnon, harms his half-sister Tamar. Another son, Absalom, takes revenge by killing Amnon and later leads a rebellion to take the throne from David. David is forced to flee Jerusalem, and there is a civil war. Absalom is killed, and David mourns deeply, even though Absalom had tried to overthrow him.

Later there is another uprising, and more conflict and violence. Near the end of the book, David orders a census, a count of the people, and a deadly plague follows. David repents again and buys a threshing floor to build an altar, ending the plague. This location later becomes important as the site connected with the temple[^gl_temple] in Jerusalem.

2 Samuel ends with extra sections including songs, David’s final words, and stories about his “mighty men,” his most loyal and skilled warriors.

## Big ideas

* The book shows leadership strengths, but also the damage caused by power misused.
* Wrong choices can have long ripple effects through families and society.
* God’s promise to David becomes important later in Jewish hopes and in Christian belief about Jesus.
