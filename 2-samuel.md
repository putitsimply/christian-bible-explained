# 2 Samuel

## What this book is

**2 Samuel** continues the story of David and shows both his best moments as a leader and his worst moral failures.

## What it contains

After King Saul dies, David is made king of the tribe of [Judah](glossary.md#judah) [^gl_judah], ruling from Hebron. At the same time, Saul’s son Ish-bosheth is made king over the other tribes of [Israel](glossary.md#israel) [^gl_israel]. There is a long conflict between the two sides, and over time David grows stronger. When Ish-bosheth is killed, the tribes of [Israel](glossary.md#israel) come together and anoint David as king over all [Israel](glossary.md#israel).

David then captures the city of [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem) [^gl_jerusalem] and makes it his capital. He also brings the Ark of the [Covenant](glossary.md#covenant) [^gl_covenant] to [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem). The Ark was a sacred chest that represented [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl_god]’s presence and [Israel](glossary.md#israel)’s [covenant](glossary.md#covenant), meaning a special agreement, with [God](glossary.md#god).

One of the most important parts of the book is [God](glossary.md#god)’s promise to David that his royal family line will continue, and that his kingdom will be established in a lasting way. This promise becomes a major idea later in the [Bible](glossary.md#bible) [^gl_bible], especially in how Christians think about Jesus.

David wins many battles and becomes famous, but then the story takes a dark turn. David commits adultery with Bathsheba, who is married to Uriah. When Bathsheba becomes pregnant, David tries to cover it up and arranges for Uriah to be killed in battle. A [prophet](glossary.md#prophet) [^gl_prophet] named Nathan confronts David, and David admits he has done wrong. David is forgiven, but the book shows that his actions still bring painful consequences for his family.

Trouble grows inside David’s household. One of David’s sons, Amnon, harms his half-sister Tamar. Another son, Absalom, takes revenge by killing Amnon and later leads a rebellion to take the throne from David. David is forced to flee [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem), and there is a civil war. Absalom is killed, and David mourns deeply, even though Absalom had tried to overthrow him.

Later there is another uprising, and more conflict and violence. Near the end of the book, David orders a census, a count of the people, and a deadly plague follows. David repents again and buys a threshing floor to build an altar, ending the plague. This location later becomes important as the site connected with the [temple](glossary.md#temple) [^gl_temple] in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem).

2 Samuel ends with extra sections including songs, David’s final words, and stories about his “mighty men,” his most loyal and skilled warriors.
