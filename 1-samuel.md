# 1 Samuel

## What this book is

**1 Samuel** tells the story of Israel[^gl_israel] changing from being led mainly by judges to being led by kings, and it follows three major people: **Samuel**, **Saul**, and **David**.

The book keeps asking, “What makes a good leader?” It compares leaders who trust God[^gl_god] and act with humility with leaders who become controlled by fear, ego, or jealousy.

## What it contains

### Samuel is born and grows up

A woman named **Hannah** cannot have children and prays deeply for a son. She promises that if she has a child, she will dedicate him to God[^gl_god]’s service. She has a son, **Samuel**, and keeps her promise by bringing him to live and work at the holy place where the priest[^gl_priest] **Eli** serves. Samuel grows up learning to listen for God’s guidance.

### The Ark is captured and returned

Israel fights the **Philistines** (a rival people). In battle, the Philistines capture the **Ark of the Covenant[^gl_covenant]**, a special sacred chest that represented God’s presence with Israel. But the Philistines have problems wherever they keep it, so they send it back to Israel. This part teaches that sacred things are not magic tools people can use to win.

### Israel asks for a king

As Samuel gets older, the people demand a king so they can be “like other nations.” Samuel warns them that a king can abuse power, but he also follows God’s direction and anoints (chooses in a formal religious way) **Saul** as Israel’s first king.

### Saul starts well, then falls apart

Saul has early victories, but he repeatedly disobeys instructions Samuel says come from God. Over time, Saul becomes more fearful and suspicious. Samuel tells Saul that God will choose another king.

### David is chosen and rises

Samuel anoints **David**, the youngest son in his family. David later becomes famous by defeating **Goliath**, a giant Philistine warrior, when others are too afraid. David also becomes close friends with Saul’s son **Jonathan**.

### Saul hunts David

Saul grows jealous of David’s success and tries to kill him. David becomes a fugitive, hiding in wilderness areas and gathering followers. Even when David has chances to kill Saul, he refuses, showing restraint and respect for Saul’s position as king.

### The tragic ending

Near the end, Saul becomes desperate and makes more damaging choices. In a final battle against the Philistines, **Saul and Jonathan are killed**, and Israel is left in grief and uncertainty.

## Big ideas

* Leadership and power can help or harm, depending on character and choices.
* The book contrasts trust and humility with fear and pride.
* Israel’s shift toward kingship changes the rest of the story in the Bible[^gl_bible].

1 Samuel also sets up the complicated story of David. He is introduced as a brave and gifted leader, but the book does not pretend leaders are perfect, and later books will show David’s serious failures too.
