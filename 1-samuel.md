# 1 Samuel

## What this book is

**1 Samuel** tells the story of [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel] changing from being led mainly by judges to being led by kings, and it follows three major people: **Samuel**, **Saul**, and **David**.

## What it contains

### Samuel is born and grows up

A woman named **Hannah** cannot have children and prays deeply for a son. She promises that if she has a child, she will dedicate him to [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s service. She has a son, **Samuel**, and keeps her promise by bringing him to live and work at the holy place where the [priest](glossary.md#priest)[^gl-priest] **Eli** serves. Samuel grows up learning to listen for [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s guidance.

### The Ark is captured and returned

[Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel] fights the **Philistines** (a rival people). In battle, the Philistines capture the **Ark of the [Covenant](glossary.md#covenant)[^gl-covenant]**, a special sacred chest that represented [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s presence with [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel]. But the Philistines have problems wherever they keep it, so they send it back to [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel]. This part teaches that sacred things are not magic tools people can use to win.

### [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel] asks for a king

As Samuel gets older, the people demand a king so they can be “like other nations.” Samuel warns them that a king can abuse power, but he also follows [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]’s direction and anoints (chooses in a formal religious way) **Saul** as [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel]’s first king.

### Saul starts well, then falls apart

Saul has early victories, but he repeatedly disobeys instructions Samuel says come from [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god]. Over time, Saul becomes more fearful and suspicious. Samuel tells Saul that [God](glossary.md#god)[^gl-god] will choose another king.

### David is chosen and rises

Samuel anoints **David**, the youngest son in his family. David later becomes famous by defeating **Goliath**, a giant Philistine warrior, when others are too afraid. David also becomes close friends with Saul’s son **Jonathan**.

### Saul hunts David

Saul grows jealous of David’s success and tries to kill him. David becomes a fugitive, hiding in wilderness areas and gathering followers. Even when David has chances to kill Saul, he refuses, showing restraint and respect for Saul’s position as king.

### The tragic ending

Near the end, Saul becomes desperate and makes more damaging choices. In a final battle against the Philistines, **Saul and Jonathan are killed**, and [Israel](glossary.md#israel)[^gl-israel] is left in grief and uncertainty.
