# 1 Samuel

## What this book is

**1 Samuel** tells the story of <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> changing from being led mainly by judges to being led by kings, and it follows three major people: **Samuel**, **Saul**, and **David**.

## What it contains

### Samuel is born and grows up

A woman named **Hannah** cannot have children and prays deeply for a son. She promises that if she has a child, she will dedicate him to <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s service. She has a son, **Samuel**, and keeps her promise by bringing him to live and work at the holy place where the <a href="glossary.md#priest" title="A religious leader in ancient Israel’s worship system.">priest</a> **Eli** serves. Samuel grows up learning to listen for <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s guidance.

### The Ark is captured and returned

<a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> fights the **Philistines** (a rival people). In battle, the Philistines capture the **Ark of the <a href="glossary.md#covenant" title="A serious promise-based relationship.">Covenant</a>**, a special sacred chest that represented <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s presence with <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>. But the Philistines have problems wherever they keep it, so they send it back to <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>. This part teaches that sacred things are not magic tools people can use to win.

### <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> asks for a king

As Samuel gets older, the people demand a king so they can be “like other nations.” Samuel warns them that a king can abuse power, but he also follows <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s direction and anoints (chooses in a formal religious way) **Saul** as <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>’s first king.

### Saul starts well, then falls apart

Saul has early victories, but he repeatedly disobeys instructions Samuel says come from <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>. Over time, Saul becomes more fearful and suspicious. Samuel tells Saul that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> will choose another king.

### David is chosen and rises

Samuel anoints **David**, the youngest son in his family. David later becomes famous by defeating **Goliath**, a giant Philistine warrior, when others are too afraid. David also becomes close friends with Saul’s son **Jonathan**.

### Saul hunts David

Saul grows jealous of David’s success and tries to kill him. David becomes a fugitive, hiding in wilderness areas and gathering followers. Even when David has chances to kill Saul, he refuses, showing restraint and respect for Saul’s position as king.

### The tragic ending

Near the end, Saul becomes desperate and makes more damaging choices. In a final battle against the Philistines, **Saul and Jonathan are killed**, and <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> is left in grief and uncertainty.
