# Jude

## What this book is

The book of Jude is a very short letter near the end of the New Testament. It is written to Christians in general, not to one specific church[^gl-church].

## What it contains

### Why Jude writes

Jude says he wanted to write a positive letter about “the salvation[^gl-salvation] we share” (salvation[^gl-salvation] means being rescued by God[^gl-god] and brought into a right relationship with him). But he changes focus because he believes the church[^gl-church] is in danger from certain teachers who have slipped in and are twisting the message about Jesus.

### The main problem Jude warns about

Jude describes these people as using God[^gl-god]’s kindness as an excuse to live in ways that hurt others and dishonour God[^gl-god]. He says they talk like they belong, but their actions show something is wrong.

In simple terms, Jude warns readers not to let persuasive teachers pull them away from what they were taught about Jesus and a good way of living.

### How Jude makes his point

Jude uses strong warning examples from earlier Bible[^gl-bible] stories to show that rebellion and wrongdoing have consequences. He refers to:

* Israelites[^gl-israel] in the wilderness who did not trust God[^gl-god].
* Angels who rebelled.
* Sodom and Gomorrah as a picture of serious moral failure.

He also mentions a couple of examples that come from Jewish traditional writings that many Jews knew at the time, like a story about a dispute over Moses’ body, and a quote linked to Enoch. Jude uses these references like illustrations to strengthen his warning, even if readers today are not familiar with the background.

### What Jude tells believers to do instead

Jude gives practical advice:

* “Contend for the faith[^gl-faith].” Here “faith[^gl-faith]” means the core message about Jesus and the way of life that goes with it, not just personal feelings.
* Build each other up, pray, and stay connected to God[^gl-god]’s love.
* Be wise and kind when helping others who are being influenced, taking care not to get dragged into the same harmful behaviour.

### How it ends

Jude finishes with a famous closing blessing that reassures readers: God[^gl-god] is able to keep people from falling and bring them safely through to the end.

Overall, Jude is a warning letter that urges readers to guard what they have been taught about Jesus, live it out, and help others do the same.

## Big ideas

* The letter warns against teaching that encourages harmful behaviour.
* It uses examples from older stories to argue that choices have consequences.
* It balances “be careful” with “help others kindly.”
