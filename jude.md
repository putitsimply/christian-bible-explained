# Jude

## What this book is

The book of Jude is a very short letter near the end of the New Testament. It is written to Christians in general, not to one specific <a href="glossary.md#church" title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</a>.

## What it contains

### Why Jude writes

Jude says he wanted to write a positive letter about “the <a href="glossary.md#salvation" title="Rescue; in Christianity, being saved from sin.">salvation</a> we share” (<a href="glossary.md#salvation" title="Rescue; in Christianity, being saved from sin.">salvation</a> means being rescued by <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> and brought into a right relationship with him). But he changes focus because he believes the <a href="glossary.md#church" title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</a> is in danger from certain teachers who have slipped in and are twisting the message about Jesus.

### The main problem Jude warns about

Jude describes these people as using <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s kindness as an excuse to live in ways that hurt others and dishonour <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>. He says they talk like they belong, but their actions show something is wrong.

In simple terms, Jude warns readers not to let persuasive teachers pull them away from what they were taught about Jesus and a good way of living.

### How Jude makes his point

Jude uses strong warning examples from earlier <a href="glossary.md#bible" title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</a> stories to show that rebellion and wrongdoing have consequences. He refers to:

* <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</a> in the wilderness who did not trust <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>.
* Angels who rebelled.
* Sodom and Gomorrah as a picture of serious moral failure.
He also mentions a couple of examples that come from Jewish traditional writings that many Jews knew at the time, like a story about a dispute over Moses’ body, and a quote linked to Enoch. Jude uses these references like illustrations to strengthen his warning, even if readers today are not familiar with the background.

### What Jude tells believers to do instead

Jude gives practical advice:

* “Contend for the <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>.” Here “<a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>” means the core message about Jesus and the way of life that goes with it, not just personal feelings.
* Build each other up, pray, and stay connected to <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s love.
* Be wise and kind when helping others who are being influenced, taking care not to get dragged into the same harmful behaviour.

### How it ends

Jude finishes with a famous closing blessing that reassures readers: <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is able to keep people from falling and bring them safely through to the end.

Overall, Jude is a warning letter that urges readers to guard what they have been taught about Jesus, live it out, and help others do the same.

## Big ideas

* The letter warns against teaching that encourages harmful behaviour.
* It uses examples from older stories to argue that choices have consequences.
* It balances “be careful” with “help others kindly.”: Rescue; in Christianity, being saved from <a href="glossary.md#sin" title="Wrongdoing; in Christianity, also a broken relationship with God.">sin</a>.
