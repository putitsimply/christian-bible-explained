# Malachi

## What this book is

Malachi is the last book in the Old Testament. It is set after God[^gl-god]’s people have returned from exile[^gl-exile] in Babylon and rebuilt the temple[^gl-temple] in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]. Life looks normal again, but the book says something is badly wrong underneath.

## What it contains

Malachi is written like a series of short arguments between God[^gl-god] and the people. God[^gl-god] makes a point, the people push back with a question like “How?” or “What is meant by that?”, then God[^gl-god] answers clearly.

Here is what happens, step by step:

* **God[^gl-god] says he still loves his people.** The people act like that is not true, because they think life is unfair. God[^gl-god] reminds them that he has stayed faithful to them across history.
* **God[^gl-god] challenges the priests[^gl-priest] and temple[^gl-temple] worship[^gl-worship].** The priests[^gl-priest] are meant to lead worship[^gl-worship] and teach what is right. Instead, they accept poor quality animal offerings and treat worship[^gl-worship] like a chore. God[^gl-god] says this is disrespectful, because offerings were meant to show honour and gratitude.
* **God[^gl-god] warns about unfairness and unfaithfulness.** Malachi speaks against people who lie, cheat workers, and take advantage of others. He also criticises faithlessness in family life, especially men treating marriage casually and abandoning their wives. The book links faithfulness to God[^gl-god] with faithfulness in everyday relationships.
* **The people complain that doing the right thing seems pointless.** Some say, “Bad people seem to do fine, so why bother obeying God[^gl-god]?” Malachi answers by saying God[^gl-god] sees what is happening, and that justice will come, even if it feels slow. A “book of remembrance” is mentioned as a picture of God[^gl-god] not forgetting those who try to live faithfully.
* **God[^gl-god] calls the people back to wholehearted commitment.** This includes honesty in worship[^gl-worship] and generosity. A famous part is about “tithes” (a regular giving of a portion of produce or income to support the temple[^gl-temple] and the needy). The message is that trust in God[^gl-god] should show up in practical choices.
* **Promise of a coming messenger and a future day of justice.** God[^gl-god] says a messenger will come to prepare the way, and that a “day” is coming when evil will be judged and those who honour God[^gl-god] will be healed and restored. Malachi ends by saying God[^gl-god] will send “Elijah” before that day. Many Christians later connect this idea to John the Baptist, but that connection is an interpretation made in the New Testament, not something Malachi spells out in detail.

Overall, Malachi is a wake-up call: stop going through the motions, start living with honesty, fairness, and faithfulness.

## Big ideas

* The book challenges “going through the motions” in religion while ignoring fairness.
* It links worship[^gl-worship], family life, and social justice as connected, not separate topics.
* It ends by looking ahead to future change and justice, which later readers interpret in different ways.
