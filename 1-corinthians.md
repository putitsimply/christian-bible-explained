# 1 Corinthians

## What this book is

1 Corinthians is a letter written by Paul (a key early Christian leader) to a Christian community in the city of Corinth. The <a href="glossary.md#church" title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</a> there had lots of problems, and Paul writes to correct them and help them live together well.

## What it contains

**1. A messy <a href="glossary.md#church" title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</a> with cliques**

Paul starts by saying the group is splitting into teams, like “I follow this leader” and “I follow that leader.” He tells them they should not treat <a href="glossary.md#church" title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</a> like a popularity contest. He says the focus should be on <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>, and that the message about Jesus is meant to produce humility, not bragging.

**2. Serious behaviour problems**

Paul deals with a case of sexual misconduct that the community was ignoring. He tells them they cannot pretend it is fine. He also warns against taking each other to court over personal disputes. He encourages them to sort conflicts fairly inside the community, with honesty and care.

**3. Life questions: marriage, singleness, and daily living**

People had questions about marriage, divorce, and whether it is better to stay single. Paul gives advice that tries to balance commitment, self-control, and what is practical in difficult situations. He also says people can serve <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> in different ways, whether married or not.

**4. Food offered to <a href="glossary.md#idol" title="An object or false god treated as most important.">idols</a>**

In Corinth, some meat sold in markets had been used in non-Christian religious ceremonies. Paul says knowledge alone is not enough. Even if someone thinks it is harmless, they should avoid doing something that pressures others to act against their conscience. The big idea is: use freedom responsibly, and care about how their choices affect others.

**5. <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">Worship</a> order and spiritual gifts**

Paul talks about how gatherings should be respectful and understandable, not chaotic. He discusses “spiritual gifts,” meaning abilities people believe <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> gives for helping others, like teaching, speaking in different languages, or encouraging. He says gifts are meant to build people up, not show off.

**6. The famous “love” chapter**

Chapter 13 explains that love is more important than any talent or religious gift. Paul describes love as patient, kind, not arrogant, and not easily angered. Without love, impressive actions mean very little.

**7. The <a href="glossary.md#resurrection" title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</a>**

Near the end, Paul argues that belief in Jesus rising from the dead is central to Christian <a href="glossary.md#faith" title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</a>. He says that Christians also hope for life after death, and he explains this with examples and images to help readers understand.

**8. Practical wrap-up**

Paul finishes with travel plans, greetings, and a request to collect money to help poor believers in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>.

## Big ideas

* Community unity matters more than popularity, cliques, or arguing about status.
* Love is treated as more important than knowledge, power, or impressive “spiritual” abilities.
* The letter connects belief (especially <a href="glossary.md#resurrection" title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</a> hope) with everyday behaviour.
