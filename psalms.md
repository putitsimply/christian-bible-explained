# Psalms

*Where this book fits:* [Old Testament](old-testament.md) → [Poetry and wisdom](ot-wisdom.md)

## What this book is

The Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 poems and songs that were used in worship[^gl_worship] and private prayer[^gl_prayer] in ancient Israel[^gl_israel]. Instead of telling one single story from start to finish, it’s more like a songbook or prayer journal that covers lots of different life situations.

Because they are poems, psalms often use imagery and comparisons (like God being “a rock” or “a shepherd”). They are not trying to be science explanations; they are trying to express feelings and ideas in a memorable way.

## What it contains

### What’s in it

* **Songs and prayers to God[^gl_god]**: People speak to God with praise, thanks, questions, and requests for help.
* **Many writers**: A lot are linked to **King David**, but others are linked to leaders, musicians, and worship groups. Some do not name an author.
* **Different “types” of psalms**:
  * **Praise**: celebrating God’s greatness and care.
  * **Lament**: honest “help me” prayers when life is hard. A lament often starts with pain but can end with trust.
  * **Thanksgiving**: gratitude after rescue or good news.
  * **Wisdom**: teaching how to live well.
  * **Royal**: connected to Israel’s king, leadership, and hopes for a good ruler.
  * **Pilgrimage/temple songs**: songs connected with travelling to Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] or worship at the temple[^gl_temple].

### What happens across the book

Even though it’s not one storyline, it is still possible to notice a “journey” through the collection:

* It begins with a focus on choosing a good path in life and trusting God.
* Many psalms then show real struggles, fear, unfairness, enemies, sickness, loneliness, and doubt. The writers often ask, “Why is this happening?” and “How long will this last?”
* Over time, the collection leans more and more toward **hope and praise**, finishing with a burst of worship in the last few psalms.

## Big ideas

* **Honesty with God**: The psalms show that faith[^gl_faith] includes joy and sadness, confidence and confusion.
* **God is seen as Creator and King**: Many psalms describe God as powerful, just, and caring for people.
* **Justice matters**: Writers often ask for wrong things to be made right.
* **Comfort and courage**: Some psalms became famous for reassurance, like Psalm 23, which pictures God as a shepherd guiding and protecting.

Some psalms include angry words about enemies. These reflect real fear and conflict in the ancient world. Many readers today treat those lines carefully, focusing on the overall themes of honesty, justice, and hope.

Psalms is used in Jewish and Christian worship. Christians use Psalms in church[^gl_church] services, in personal prayer, and sometimes connect certain psalms to Jesus, but the book itself is mainly a shared collection of prayers and songs about life with God.
