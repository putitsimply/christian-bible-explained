# Psalms

## What this book is

The Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 poems and songs that were used in <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> and private <a href="glossary.md#prayer"><span title="Speaking to God (silently or aloud).">prayer</span></a> in ancient <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>. Instead of telling one single story from start to finish, it’s more like a songbook or <a href="glossary.md#prayer"><span title="Speaking to God (silently or aloud).">prayer</span></a> journal that covers lots of different life situations.

## What it contains

### What’s in it

* **Songs and prayers to <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>**: People speak to <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> with praise, thanks, questions, and requests for help.
* **Many writers**: A lot are linked to **King David**, but others are linked to leaders, musicians, and <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> groups. Some do not name an author.
* **Different “types” of psalms**:
 * **Praise**: celebrating <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s greatness and care.

 * **Lament**: honest “help me” prayers when life is hard. A lament often starts with pain but can end with trust.

 * **Thanksgiving**: gratitude after rescue or good news.

 * **Wisdom**: teaching how to live well.

 * **Royal**: connected to <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>’s king, leadership, and hopes for a good ruler.

### What happens across the book

Even though it’s not one storyline, it is still possible to notice a “journey” through the collection:

* It begins with a focus on choosing a good path in life and trusting <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>.
* Many psalms then show real struggles, fear, unfairness, enemies, sickness, loneliness, and doubt. The writers often ask, “Why is this happening?” and “How long will this last?”
* Over time, the collection leans more and more toward **hope and praise**, finishing with a burst of <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> in the last few psalms.

## Big ideas

* **Honesty with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>**: The psalms show that <a href="glossary.md#faith"><span title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</span></a> includes joy and sadness, confidence and confusion.
* **<a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> is seen as Creator and King**: Many psalms describe <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> as powerful, just, and caring for people.
* **Justice matters**: Writers often ask for wrong things to be made right.
* **Comfort and courage**: Some psalms became famous for reassurance, like Psalm 23, which pictures <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> as a shepherd guiding and protecting.
Christians use Psalms in <a href="glossary.md#church"><span title="A community of Christians, not just a building.">church</span></a> services, in personal <a href="glossary.md#prayer"><span title="Speaking to God (silently or aloud).">prayer</span></a>, and sometimes connect certain psalms to Jesus, but the book itself is mainly a shared collection of prayers and songs about life with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>.
