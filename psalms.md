# Psalms

## What this book is

The Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 poems and songs that were used in worship[^gl-worship] and private prayer[^gl-prayer] in ancient Israel[^gl-israel]. Instead of telling one single story from start to finish, it’s more like a songbook or prayer[^gl-prayer] journal that covers lots of different life situations.

## What it contains

### What’s in it

* **Songs and prayers to God[^gl-god]**: People speak to God[^gl-god] with praise, thanks, questions, and requests for help.
* **Many writers**: A lot are linked to **King David**, but others are linked to leaders, musicians, and worship[^gl-worship] groups. Some do not name an author.
* **Different “types” of psalms**:
  * **Praise**: celebrating God[^gl-god]’s greatness and care.
  * **Lament**: honest “help me” prayers when life is hard. A lament often starts with pain but can end with trust.
  * **Thanksgiving**: gratitude after rescue or good news.
  * **Wisdom**: teaching how to live well.
  * **Royal**: connected to Israel[^gl-israel]’s king, leadership, and hopes for a good ruler.

### What happens across the book

Even though it’s not one storyline, it is still possible to notice a “journey” through the collection:

* It begins with a focus on choosing a good path in life and trusting God[^gl-god].
* Many psalms then show real struggles, fear, unfairness, enemies, sickness, loneliness, and doubt. The writers often ask, “Why is this happening?” and “How long will this last?”
* Over time, the collection leans more and more toward **hope and praise**, finishing with a burst of worship[^gl-worship] in the last few psalms.

## Big ideas

* **Honesty with God[^gl-god]**: The psalms show that faith[^gl-faith] includes joy and sadness, confidence and confusion.
* **God[^gl-god] is seen as Creator and King**: Many psalms describe God[^gl-god] as powerful, just, and caring for people.
* **Justice matters**: Writers often ask for wrong things to be made right.
* **Comfort and courage**: Some psalms became famous for reassurance, like Psalm 23, which pictures God[^gl-god] as a shepherd guiding and protecting.

Christians use Psalms in church[^gl-church] services, in personal prayer[^gl-prayer], and sometimes connect certain psalms to Jesus, but the book itself is mainly a shared collection of prayers and songs about life with God[^gl-god].
