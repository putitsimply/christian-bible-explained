# 2 Peter

## What this book is

2 Peter is a short letter in the New Testament. It is written to Christians to help them stay steady in their faith, especially when confusing teaching is spreading.

## What it contains

### 1) Growing in character and trusting what has been taught (chapter 1)

The writer begins by saying that knowing God should change how a person lives. He urges believers to “grow” step by step in good qualities, like self control, perseverance, kindness, and love. The idea is that faith is not meant to stay small, it should produce a better life.

He also says he is reminding them of these things because he will not be around forever. He points to two main reasons they should take the message seriously:

* He says the apostles were not making up stories about Jesus, they were passing on what they believed was real.
* He talks about the Scriptures (the holy writings) and warns people not to twist them to fit their own ideas.

### 2) Beware of false teachers (chapter 2)

Next, the letter gives a strong warning: some teachers will pretend to be trustworthy but will actually lead people away from what is right. The writer says these teachers can be persuasive and may use religion for money, popularity, or power.

To show that harmful choices have consequences, the letter gives examples of judgment stories that were well known in Jewish tradition, like the flood in Noah’s time and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It also gives an example of a prophet named Balaam, who is remembered as someone tempted by greed.

The main message is: do not follow leaders who promise freedom but live selfishly and drag others into harm.

### 3) Why has Jesus not returned yet? (chapter 3)

Some people were saying, “If Jesus is meant to return, why has nothing happened?” The letter replies that God’s timing is not the same as human timing. What feels like a long delay may actually be patience, giving people more time to turn back and do what is right.

It also describes “the day of the Lord,” meaning a future time when God will judge evil and set things right. The goal is not to scare people for fun, but to encourage them to live well now, as if their choices truly matter. It ends with hope for “a new heaven and a new earth,” meaning a renewed world where goodness belongs.

The letter finishes by saying some of Paul’s writings are hard to understand, and warns people not to twist them. It encourages readers to keep growing and stay grounded.

## Big ideas

* Faith is presented as something that should shape character and behaviour over time.
* The letter warns about teachers who use religion for selfish reasons.
* Future hope is used to motivate good living now, not panic.
