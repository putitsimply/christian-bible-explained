# Amos

## What this book is

Amos is a short Old Testament book where a <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</span></a> named Amos delivers tough warnings, mainly to the northern kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>. Amos is not described as a professional <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</span></a>. He is introduced as a shepherd and someone who cared for fig trees, coming from <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a> (the southern kingdom) to speak in <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> (the north).

## What it contains

### What happens in the book

Amos begins by announcing that <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> is judging several nearby nations for their violence and cruelty. Then the message turns sharply toward <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a>, and especially toward <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>. The surprising point is that <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> is not being judged because it is weak or ignorant, but because it thinks it is safe and successful while treating people badly.

A major focus is injustice. Amos repeatedly attacks things like:

* rich people exploiting the poor
* unfair courts where the powerful win
* dishonest business practices, like cheating with weights and prices
* comfortable religious life that ignores suffering
Amos also challenges the idea that doing religious ceremonies automatically makes everything right. The book pictures people offering <a href="glossary.md#sacrifice"><span title="An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).">sacrifices</span></a> and singing songs while, at the same time, society is unfair. Amos says that what <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> wants is justice and right behaviour, not just rituals.

Another key idea is “the Day of the Lord.” Some people in <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> expected this “day” to mean <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> would defeat their enemies and reward them. Amos warns that, because of their wrongdoing, it will be a day of judgment for them instead.

### Visions and a confrontation

In the second half of the book, Amos describes a series of visions (picture-like messages) that show judgment is coming:

* a plague of locusts
* a consuming fire
* a plumb line (a tool used to check if a wall is straight), meaning <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> is “out of line”
* a basket of ripe fruit, meaning <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> is “ripe” for consequences
* a vision of the Lord near the altar, showing no one can hide from what is coming
Amos also clashes with Amaziah, a <a href="glossary.md#priest"><span title="A religious leader in ancient Israel’s worship system.">priest</span></a> connected with the royal sanctuary at Bethel. Amaziah tells Amos to go home and stop prophesying. Amos replies that he did not choose this job for fame or money, he believes he was sent to speak.

### How it ends

Most of Amos is warning and judgment, but the book ends with a hopeful promise. It speaks about restoration in the future, using the image of rebuilding David’s “fallen shelter” and the land becoming fruitful again. Different readers understand the details of that hope in different ways, but the ending clearly shifts from punishment to the possibility of renewal.

## Big ideas

* Religious practice without justice is strongly criticised.
* The book challenges comfortable people who benefit from unfair systems.
* Warning is paired with hope: renewal is imagined after consequences.
