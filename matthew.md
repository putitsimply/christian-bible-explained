# Matthew

## What this book is

The book of Matthew is one of the four <a href="glossary.md#gospel" title="“Good news”; also the four books about Jesus’ life.">Gospels</a>, which are books that tell the story of Jesus’ life, teaching, and death, and (in Christian belief) his <a href="glossary.md#resurrection" title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</a>. Matthew is organised like a biography mixed with lots of teaching.

## What it contains

Matthew starts by introducing Jesus’ family line and then tells the story of Jesus’ birth. It includes the visit of the wise men, King Herod’s fear of losing power, and how Jesus’ family escapes danger by going to Egypt and later returning to live in Nazareth.

Next, John the Baptist appears, calling people to change their lives and get ready for <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s work. Jesus is baptised, then spends time in the wilderness being tempted. After that, Jesus begins travelling around teaching, healing sick people, and calling followers called <a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a> (close students who learn from a teacher and travel with them).

A major section is the Sermon on the Mount (chapters 5 to 7). Here Jesus teaches about what a good life looks like, including kindness, honesty, forgiveness, <a href="glossary.md#prayer" title="Speaking to God (silently or aloud).">prayer</a>, and caring about what is right on the inside, not just looking good on the outside.

Matthew then shows Jesus doing many actions people saw as signs of <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s power, like healing and helping people who were suffering. Jesus also teaches in <a href="glossary.md#parable" title="A short teaching story.">parables</a>, which are short story-like examples that make a point (often about <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s “kingdom”, meaning <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s rule and ways). Some famous <a href="glossary.md#parable" title="A short teaching story.">parables</a> include the sower and the seeds.

As the story goes on, Jesus argues more with some religious leaders, often called <a href="glossary.md#pharisees" title="A Jewish religious group in Jesus’ time.">Pharisees</a> and teachers of the law. Matthew shows these conflicts as being about hypocrisy, power, and missing the heart of <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s commands. Jesus also asks his <a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a> who they think he is, and Peter calls him the <a href="glossary.md#messiah" title="“Anointed one”; a chosen leader. Christians apply it to Jesus.">Messiah</a> (a special leader <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> promised, sometimes understood as a rescuer king). Another key moment is the transfiguration, when Jesus is seen in a bright, changed way on a mountain.

Near the end, Jesus goes to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>. He is welcomed like a king, teaches in the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</a>, and gives strong warnings about injustice and pretending to be good. He shares a final meal with his <a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a>, is arrested, and is put on trial. He is crucified (executed on a cross), and Matthew describes events that show how shocking and significant this was for his followers.

Finally, Matthew tells of Jesus’ <a href="glossary.md#resurrection" title="Life after death; Christians believe Jesus rose.">resurrection</a> (Christians believe he was raised back to life). The book ends with Jesus sending his <a href="glossary.md#disciple" title="A close student or follower of a teacher.">disciples</a> out to teach others.

## Big ideas

* Matthew often connects Jesus to Jewish hopes for a <a href="glossary.md#messiah" title="“Anointed one”; a chosen leader.
