# Matthew

## What this book is

The book of Matthew is one of the four Gospels, which are books that tell the story of Jesus’ life, teaching, and death, and (in Christian belief) his [resurrection](glossary.md#resurrection). Matthew is organised like a biography mixed with lots of teaching.

## What it contains

Matthew starts by introducing Jesus’ family line and then tells the story of Jesus’ birth. It includes the visit of the wise men, King Herod’s fear of losing power, and how Jesus’ family escapes danger by going to Egypt and later returning to live in Nazareth.

Next, John the Baptist appears, calling people to change their lives and get ready for [God](glossary.md#god)’s work. Jesus is baptised, then spends time in the wilderness being tempted. After that, Jesus begins travelling around teaching, healing sick people, and calling followers called [disciples](glossary.md#disciple) (close students who learn from a teacher and travel with them).

A major section is the Sermon on the Mount (chapters 5 to 7). Here Jesus teaches about what a good life looks like, including kindness, honesty, forgiveness, [prayer](glossary.md#prayer), and caring about what is right on the inside, not just looking good on the outside.

Matthew then shows Jesus doing many actions people saw as signs of [God](glossary.md#god)’s power, like healing and helping people who were suffering. Jesus also teaches in [parables](glossary.md#parable), which are short story-like examples that make a point (often about [God](glossary.md#god)’s “kingdom”, meaning [God](glossary.md#god)’s rule and ways). Some famous [parables](glossary.md#parable) include the sower and the seeds.

As the story goes on, Jesus argues more with some religious leaders, often called [Pharisees](glossary.md#pharisees) and teachers of the law. Matthew shows these conflicts as being about hypocrisy, power, and missing the heart of [God](glossary.md#god)’s commands. Jesus also asks his [disciples](glossary.md#disciple) who they think he is, and Peter calls him the [Messiah](glossary.md#messiah) (a special leader [God](glossary.md#god) promised, sometimes understood as a rescuer king). Another key moment is the transfiguration, when Jesus is seen in a bright, changed way on a mountain.

Near the end, Jesus goes to [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem). He is welcomed like a king, teaches in the [temple](glossary.md#temple), and gives strong warnings about injustice and pretending to be good. He shares a final meal with his [disciples](glossary.md#disciple), is arrested, and is put on trial. He is crucified (executed on a cross), and Matthew describes events that show how shocking and significant this was for his followers.

Finally, Matthew tells of Jesus’ [resurrection](glossary.md#resurrection) (Christians believe he was raised back to life). The book ends with Jesus sending his [disciples](glossary.md#disciple) out to teach others.

## Big ideas

* Jesus’ teaching focuses on inner character as well as outward actions.
* The story builds toward conflict in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem), ending in [crucifixion](glossary.md#crucifixion) and (in Christian belief) [resurrection](glossary.md#resurrection).
* Matthew often connects Jesus to Jewish hopes for a [Messiah](glossary.md#messiah) and for [God](glossary.md#god)’s kingdom ([God](glossary.md#god)’s rule and ways).
