# Old Testament

The Old Testament is the first big section of the Christian Bible[^gl-bible]. Many of these books are also part of Jewish scriptures (often called the Hebrew Bible[^gl-bible]), though the order and naming can differ. The Old Testament tells a long story about God[^gl-god], the world, and the people of Israel[^gl-israel], across many centuries. It is made up of different kinds of writing, like stories, laws, poems, prayers, proverbs, and messages from prophets[^gl-prophet].

It begins with the early “big picture” stories. Genesis describes God[^gl-god] creating the world and humans, and it introduces big ideas like humans choosing right and wrong, and how broken relationships lead to conflict. It then focuses on one family, starting with Abraham, then Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. These stories explain how the Israelites[^gl-israel] see their beginnings and their relationship with God[^gl-god] through promises.

Next comes the rescue story. In Exodus, the Israelites[^gl-israel] are enslaved in Egypt, and Moses leads them out. After this, books like Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy describe laws and instructions for living as a community. These include rules about worship[^gl-worship], justice, and caring for others, and they present the idea of a covenant[^gl-covenant], which means a serious agreement between God[^gl-god] and the people.

Then the story turns to the land and leadership. Joshua describes the Israelites[^gl-israel] entering and settling in Canaan. Judges shows a cycle where the people drift away from God[^gl-god], face trouble, then are rescued by leaders called judges. After that, 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings tell about Israel[^gl-israel] becoming a kingdom. Saul is the first king, then David, then Solomon, who builds the temple[^gl-temple] in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]. After Solomon, the kingdom splits into two parts, Israel[^gl-israel] in the north and Judah[^gl-judah] in the south, and both struggle with corruption, injustice, and turning to other gods.

Alongside these history books are the prophets[^gl-prophet]. Prophets[^gl-prophet] were messengers who challenged leaders and ordinary people to return to faithful worship[^gl-worship] and fair living, especially protecting the poor and being honest. They also warned that ignoring justice would lead to disaster. Eventually, these warnings come true. Powerful empires conquer the kingdoms, Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] is destroyed, and many people are taken into exile[^gl-exile], meaning they are forced to live far from home.

The Old Testament also includes wisdom and worship[^gl-worship] books. Psalms is a collection of prayers and songs covering joy, fear, anger, and hope. Proverbs gives advice for living wisely. Job wrestles with suffering and fairness. Ecclesiastes reflects on meaning and purpose. Song of Songs is love poetry.

Finally, books like Ezra and Nehemiah describe some Israelites[^gl-israel] returning from exile[^gl-exile] and rebuilding their community. The Old Testament ends with hope and questions, especially about how God[^gl-god] will restore things and what faithful living should look like.
