# Old Testament

The Old Testament is the first big section of the Christian <a href="glossary.md#bible"><span title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</span></a>. Many of these books are also part of Jewish scriptures (often called the Hebrew <a href="glossary.md#bible"><span title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</span></a>), though the order and naming can differ. The Old Testament tells a long story about <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>, the world, and the people of <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>, across many centuries. It is made up of different kinds of writing, like stories, laws, poems, prayers, proverbs, and messages from <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</span></a>.

It begins with the early “big picture” stories. Genesis describes <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> creating the world and humans, and it introduces big ideas like humans choosing right and wrong, and how broken relationships lead to conflict. It then focuses on one family, starting with Abraham, then Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. These stories explain how the <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</span></a> see their beginnings and their relationship with <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> through promises.

Next comes the rescue story. In Exodus, the <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</span></a> are enslaved in Egypt, and Moses leads them out. After this, books like Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy describe laws and instructions for living as a community. These include rules about <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a>, justice, and caring for others, and they present the idea of a <a href="glossary.md#covenant"><span title="A serious promise-based relationship.">covenant</span></a>, which means a serious agreement between <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> and the people.

Then the story turns to the land and leadership. Joshua describes the <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</span></a> entering and settling in Canaan. Judges shows a cycle where the people drift away from <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>, face trouble, then are rescued by leaders called judges. After that, 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings tell about <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> becoming a kingdom. Saul is the first king, then David, then Solomon, who builds the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a> in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>. After Solomon, the kingdom splits into two parts, <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> in the north and <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a> in the south, and both struggle with corruption, injustice, and turning to other gods.

Alongside these history books are the <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</span></a>. <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">Prophets</span></a> were messengers who challenged leaders and ordinary people to return to faithful <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> and fair living, especially protecting the poor and being honest. They also warned that ignoring justice would lead to disaster. Eventually, these warnings come true. Powerful empires conquer the kingdoms, <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a> is destroyed, and many people are taken into <a href="glossary.md#exile"><span title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</span></a>, meaning they are forced to live far from home.

The Old Testament also includes wisdom and <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> books. Psalms is a collection of prayers and songs covering joy, fear, anger, and hope. Proverbs gives advice for living wisely. Job wrestles with suffering and fairness. Ecclesiastes reflects on meaning and purpose. Song of Songs is love poetry.

Finally, books like Ezra and Nehemiah describe some <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israelites</span></a> returning from <a href="glossary.md#exile"><span title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</span></a> and rebuilding their community. The Old Testament ends with hope and questions, especially about how <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> will restore things and what faithful living should look like.
