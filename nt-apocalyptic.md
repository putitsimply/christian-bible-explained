# Apocalyptic

Apocalyptic writing[^gl_apocalyptic_writing] uses vivid symbols and visions to talk about fear, justice, and hope. It often describes evil in dramatic pictures and promises that it will not last forever.

Different readers interpret these symbols in different ways, so this guide focuses on the main themes rather than trying to decode every image.

## Books in this section

* [Revelation](revelation.md): symbolic visions encouraging Christians facing pressure.

[^gl_apocalyptic_writing]: A symbol-filled writing style about justice and hope. ([Glossary](glossary.md#apocalyptic-writing))
