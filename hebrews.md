# Hebrews

## What this book is

Hebrews is a New Testament book written to encourage a group of Christians who were getting tired, scared, or unsure, and were tempted to give up or go back to older religious practices. We are not certain who wrote it, and it reads more like a thoughtful sermon or speech than a normal letter.

## What it contains

### What the writer is trying to do

The big idea is: “Stick with Jesus.” The writer argues that Jesus is greater than anything they might be tempted to trust instead.

### Main points, step by step

1. **Jesus is “better” than earlier messengers and leaders.**\
 The writer compares Jesus to important figures and ideas from the Jewish Scriptures (like angels, Moses, and [priests](glossary.md#priest "A religious leader in ancient Israel’s worship system.")) and keeps saying, in effect, “Jesus is greater, so don’t walk away.”

2. **A warning about “drifting.”**\
 The writer says people can slowly drift away if they stop paying attention and stop holding on to what they have learned. It is pictured like a boat quietly floating off course.

3. **Jesus as the “[high priest](glossary.md#high-priest "The chief priest in ancient Israel’s worship system.").”**\
 A [high priest](glossary.md#high-priest "The chief priest in ancient Israel’s worship system.") was the main religious leader who represented the people before [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity."). Hebrews says Jesus does that job in the best possible way, because he understands human weakness and helps people come close to [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.").

4. **One [sacrifice](glossary.md#sacrifice "An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament)."), not repeated [sacrifices](glossary.md#sacrifice "An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).").**\
 In the old [temple](glossary.md#temple "The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.") system, [sacrifices](glossary.md#sacrifice "An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).") happened again and again. Hebrews says Jesus’ death was a once and for all [sacrifice](glossary.md#sacrifice "An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament)."), meaning it does not need to be repeated. The writer uses this to explain why they should not go back to the old system.

5. **The famous “[faith](glossary.md#faith "Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.")” chapter (Hebrews 11).**\
 Hebrews lists many earlier believers (like Abraham and Moses) and shows how they kept going through hard times by trusting [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.")’s promises.

6. **Keep going, even when it is hard (Hebrews 12–13).**\
 The writer urges the readers to endure like runners in a race, to help each other, and to live in practical ways: show kindness, be honest, avoid greed, respect leaders, and keep doing good.

### How it ends

Hebrews finishes with encouragement, a blessing, and a few personal notes, including mention of Timothy. The overall message stays the same: the writer urges readers not to give up, and to keep trusting and living faithfully.

## Big ideas

* The writer keeps repeating: “Stick with Jesus,” especially when people feel tired or afraid.
* Jesus is described as greater than earlier leaders, and as someone who helps people come close to [God](glossary.md#god "The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.").
