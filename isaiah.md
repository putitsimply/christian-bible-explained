# Isaiah

## What this book is

Isaiah is a long book made up of messages, poems, and visions linked to a <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a> named Isaiah. A <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a> is someone people believed was chosen to deliver <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s message. Most of Isaiah speaks to the kingdom of <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> (where <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> is), during a time when powerful empires threatened them and many leaders were being unfair.

## What it contains

### What happens in the book

**1) Warnings about what is going wrong (roughly Isaiah 1 to 39)**\
Isaiah says <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> has serious problems, not just “breaking rules,” but hurting people. He calls out:

* unfair courts and leaders who take advantage of the poor
* empty religion, doing ceremonies while ignoring justice and kindness
* trusting military power and political deals more than doing what is right
Isaiah warns that if <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> keeps going this way, disaster will come. Some parts connect to real historical danger, like the Assyrian Empire threatening <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>. There is also a famous story where King Hezekiah faces invasion and later becomes sick, and Isaiah gives him messages about both fear and hope.

**2) Comfort for people in <a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a> and hope of return (roughly Isaiah 40 to 55)**\
Later, the tone changes. These chapters speak as if many people from <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> have been taken away from their land (<a href="glossary.md#exile" title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</a>). Isaiah’s message becomes:

* “Do not give up, comfort is coming.”
* <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> will bring people home and rebuild what was lost.
These chapters include poems about a mysterious “servant” who suffers and helps others. Jewish readers often understand this servant in collective ways (like <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> as a people), while Christians often connect these passages to Jesus. The book itself presents the servant as someone whose suffering leads to healing and justice for others.

**3) What a restored community should look like (roughly Isaiah 56 to 66)**\
The final section focuses on how people should live after restoration: with honesty, fairness, and care for those pushed aside. It also looks forward to a future where peace and justice are fully established. The book ends with big-picture hope, including images of a renewed world where things are set right.

## Big ideas

Isaiah is about two connected themes: **justice now** (stop harming others) and **hope ahead** (restoration after failure), with a strong focus on what a truly good society should look like.
