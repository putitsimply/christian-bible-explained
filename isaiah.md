# Isaiah

## What this book is

Isaiah is a long book made up of messages, poems, and visions linked to a prophet[^gl_prophet] named Isaiah. A prophet is someone people believed was chosen to deliver God[^gl_god]’s message. Most of Isaiah speaks to the kingdom of Judah[^gl_judah] (where Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] is), during a time when powerful empires threatened them and many leaders were being unfair.

## What it contains

### What happens in the book

**1) Warnings about what is going wrong (roughly Isaiah 1 to 39)**\
Isaiah says Judah has serious problems, not just “breaking rules,” but hurting people. He calls out:

* unfair courts and leaders who take advantage of the poor
* empty religion, doing ceremonies while ignoring justice and kindness
* trusting military power and political deals more than doing what is right
Isaiah warns that if Judah keeps going this way, disaster will come. Some parts connect to real historical danger, like the Assyrian Empire threatening Jerusalem. There is also a famous story where King Hezekiah faces invasion and later becomes sick, and Isaiah gives him messages about both fear and hope.

**2) Comfort for people in exile[^gl_exile] and hope of return (roughly Isaiah 40 to 55)**\
Later, the tone changes. These chapters speak as if many people from Judah have been taken away from their land (exile). Isaiah’s message becomes:

* “Do not give up, comfort is coming.”
* God will bring people home and rebuild what was lost.
These chapters include poems about a mysterious “servant” who suffers and helps others. Jewish readers often understand this servant in collective ways (like Israel[^gl_israel] as a people), while Christians often connect these passages to Jesus. The book itself presents the servant as someone whose suffering leads to healing and justice for others.

**3) What a restored community should look like (roughly Isaiah 56 to 66)**\
The final section focuses on how people should live after restoration: with honesty, fairness, and care for those pushed aside. It also looks forward to a future where peace and justice are fully established. The book ends with big-picture hope, including images of a renewed world where things are set right.

## Big ideas

Isaiah is about two connected themes: **justice now** (stop harming others) and **hope ahead** (restoration after failure), with a strong focus on what a truly good society should look like.

It also uses some of the Bible[^gl_bible]’s most famous images, like swords being turned into farming tools, and a world where nations learn peace. Because of that, Isaiah is often quoted in discussions about justice, leadership, and hope.
