# Obadiah

## What this book is

Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament, only 21 verses. It is written like a strong message against a neighbouring nation called **Edom**. Edom is criticised for how it treated <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> when <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> was attacked.

## What it contains

Obadiah is short, but it has a clear flow:

* **Edom will be brought down:** Edom is pictured as feeling safe because of its location and strength, but the message says pride will not protect it.
* **Why Edom is blamed:** the book accuses Edom of standing by (or even joining in) when <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> was in trouble, and of taking advantage instead of helping.
* **A bigger idea (“the Day of the Lord”):** this phrase is used in the <a href="glossary.md#bible" title="Christian sacred writings: many books and types of writing.">Bible</a> for a time when <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> is pictured as stepping in to judge unfairness and set things right. In Obadiah, it means what Edom did will come back on them, and other nations are not “untouchable” either.
* **Hope after judgement:** the final lines imagine safety and restoration for <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s people, and end with the idea that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>’s rule is the final outcome.

## Big ideas

* Pride and gloating over others’ suffering are treated as serious moral failures.
* Being a “neighbour” includes responsibility: doing nothing in a crisis can still be wrong.
* The book combines judgement language with hope that injustice does not have the last word.
