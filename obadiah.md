# Obadiah

*Where this book fits:* [Old Testament](old-testament.md) → [Minor prophets](ot-minor-prophets.md)

## What this book is

Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament, only 21 verses. It is written like a strong message against a neighbouring nation called **Edom**. Edom is criticised for how it treated Judah[^gl_judah] when Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem] was attacked.

In the Bible’s larger story, Edom is connected to Israel[^gl_israel] through family links (Edom is associated with Esau, the brother of Jacob/Israel). That is part of why the anger in Obadiah feels so intense: it is not just “a foreign enemy,” but a neighbour with a close history.

The book is written as prophetic poetry. That means it uses strong images and short, memorable lines, more like a speech than a history report.

## What it contains

Obadiah is short, but it has a clear flow:

* **Edom will be brought down:** Edom is pictured as feeling safe because of its location and strength, but the message says pride will not protect it.
* **Why Edom is blamed:** the book accuses Edom of standing by (or even joining in) when Judah was in trouble, and of taking advantage instead of helping.
* **A bigger idea (“the Day of the Lord”):** this phrase is used in the Bible[^gl_bible] for a time when God[^gl_god] is pictured as stepping in to judge unfairness and set things right. In Obadiah, it means what Edom did will come back on them, and other nations are not “untouchable” either.
* **Hope after judgement:** the final lines imagine safety and restoration for God’s people, and end with the idea that God’s rule is the final outcome.

One thing that makes Obadiah interesting is that it connects a local conflict (Judah and Edom) to a larger moral message. It says that how you treat vulnerable people matters, even during war or disasters, and that taking advantage of suffering is not “smart”, it is wrong.

## Big ideas

* Pride and gloating over others’ suffering are treated as serious moral failures.
* Being a “neighbour” includes responsibility: doing nothing in a crisis can still be wrong.
* The book combines judgement language with hope that injustice does not have the last word.
