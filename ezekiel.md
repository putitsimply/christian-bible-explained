# Ezekiel

## What this book is

Ezekiel is a book about a prophet[^gl-prophet] named Ezekiel who lived during a very hard time for the people of Judah[^gl-judah]. Many of them had been taken away from their homeland to Babylon. This is called “exile[^gl-exile],” which means being forced to live far from home because a stronger power has conquered them.

## What it contains

### 1) Ezekiel’s strange first vision and his job

At the start, Ezekiel has a dramatic “vision,” which means a powerful, symbolic scene he believes God[^gl-god] is showing him. He sees a stormy cloud, four living creatures, and wheels that look like they are full of eyes. The main point is that God[^gl-god] is not trapped in one place. Even though the people are far from Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem], Ezekiel’s vision shows God[^gl-god] can still see, act, and speak in exile[^gl-exile].

Ezekiel is then told to be a “watchman,” like someone posted on a city wall to warn others of danger. His role is to tell people uncomfortable truths and warn them about the results of their choices.

### 2) Warnings about Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] and the reasons for disaster

A large part of Ezekiel is about warnings that Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] will fall. Ezekiel says the disaster is connected to long-term injustice and unfaithfulness, especially worshipping other gods and treating people wrongly. The book uses strong images to say, “This did not happen for no reason.”

Ezekiel often acts out messages using symbolic actions, like building a model of a city under siege, lying on his side for long periods, or packing bags like someone going into exile[^gl-exile].

### 3) Messages to other nations

After the warnings about Judah[^gl-judah], Ezekiel includes speeches against nearby nations. The idea is that powerful neighbours are also accountable for violence, pride, and cruelty.

### 4) A turn toward hope and restoration

After Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] is described as falling, the book shifts. Ezekiel begins to speak about future healing: a return home, renewed commitment to doing what is right, and a fresh start.

One famous scene is the “valley of dry bones.” Ezekiel sees a valley full of bones that come back to life. It is a picture of a nation that feels dead and hopeless being rebuilt again.

### 5) A new temple[^gl-temple] and a new community

Near the end, Ezekiel has another long vision, this time of a new temple[^gl-temple] and a reorganised land. It is detailed and symbolic. The big message is order, peace, and God[^gl-god]’s presence returning to be with the people.

Overall, Ezekiel moves from warning to hope: actions have consequences, but rebuilding is possible after collapse.

## Big ideas

* God[^gl-god]’s presence is shown as not limited to one place (even in exile[^gl-exile]).
* After judgement language, the book turns to hope, renewal, and rebuilding.
