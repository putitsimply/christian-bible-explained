# Acts

## What this book is

Acts is the story of what happens after Jesus’ death and (in Christian belief) his resurrection[^gl-resurrection], focusing on how his followers spread the Christian message across the Roman world. It follows a group called the apostles[^gl-apostle], meaning “sent ones,” who believed Jesus had chosen them to continue his work.

## What it contains

**1) The beginning in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]**
Acts starts by saying Jesus appeared to his followers for a short time, then returned to heaven (often called the Ascension[^gl-ascension]). The followers stay in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]. Soon after, a major Jewish festival called Pentecost[^gl-pentecost] happens. The followers believe God[^gl-god] gives them the Holy Spirit[^gl-holy-spirit], which in Christian belief is God[^gl-god]’s presence and power working with people. They begin preaching boldly, and many people join them.

**2) Peter and the early community**
A leader named Peter becomes very important early on. He speaks to crowds, heals people, and faces opposition from local leaders who think the apostles[^gl-apostle] are causing trouble. The community shares food and money to help those in need. There are also problems, like disagreements and unfairness, and the group appoints helpers to make sure people are cared for fairly.

One major moment is when a follower named Stephen is killed for his beliefs. This leads to increased persecution, and many followers leave Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem], which spreads the movement to new places.

**3) The message spreads beyond Jewish people**
Acts shows a big change: the message is not only for Jewish people. A Roman officer named Cornelius and his household join, and Peter accepts them. This matters because it opens the movement to Gentiles[^gl-gentile], meaning non Jewish people.

**4) Paul’s conversion and journeys**
A man named Saul (later called Paul) begins as someone who tries to stop the followers. Then he has a dramatic experience and becomes a believer. Paul becomes the main figure for the rest of the book.

Paul travels widely, starting communities in many cities, teaching in synagogues and public places, and often facing hostility, riots, and arrests.

**5) A key meeting in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]**
Leaders meet in Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] to decide whether Gentile[^gl-gentile] believers must follow all Jewish laws, like circumcision. They decide Gentiles[^gl-gentile] can join without becoming fully Jewish, but they should follow some basic guidelines to avoid major conflict.

**6) Trials and the trip to Rome**
Paul is arrested, put on trial several times, and eventually appeals to Caesar, which sends him to Rome. The book ends with Paul in Rome under guard, still teaching.

## Big ideas

* A small group turns into a wider movement through travel, communication, and community life.
* The story shows major disagreements (especially about Jews and non-Jews) and how leaders try to solve them.
* Hardship and opposition are presented as normal parts of the early Christian story.
