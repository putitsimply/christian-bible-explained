# 2 John

## What this book is

2 John is a very short letter in the New Testament. It is written by someone who calls himself “the elder,” and Christians have traditionally linked him with John, one of Jesus’ closest followers.

## What it contains

### Who it is written to

The letter is addressed to “the chosen lady and her children.” Some people think this means a real woman and her family. Others think it is a picture name for a local church[^gl-church] community and its members. Either way, the message is aimed at a group of believers who are trying to follow Jesus.

### What happens in the letter

The writer begins warmly. He says he loves them “in the truth,” meaning he cares about them because they share the same message about Jesus and want to live honestly. He is happy that some of them are “walking in the truth,” which means their everyday choices match what they believe.

Then he focuses on two big ideas:

1. **Truth and love belong together.**\
   He reminds them of a command they have had “from the beginning,” to love one another. He explains that love is not just a feeling, it shows up in actions, especially in obeying what Jesus taught.
2. **Be careful about false teachers.**\
   He warns that “deceivers” have gone out into the world. These are people who teach wrong things about Jesus, especially denying that Jesus truly came as a real human being. The writer says to watch out so they do not lose what they have worked for.

He uses a strong word, **“antichrist.”** In this letter, it does not mean one movie style villain. It describes teaching that is against the message about Jesus, and the people spreading it.

### A very practical instruction

The writer tells them not to welcome these false teachers into their homes or support them, because helping them would be like helping their harmful work continue. In that time, traveling teachers often relied on hospitality, so this was a serious warning about not giving credibility or resources to teaching the community believed was untrue.

### How it ends

He says he has more to tell them but prefers to speak face to face, and he hopes to visit soon. He finishes with greetings from another connected Christian group, which suggests friendly support between communities.

## Big ideas

* Love and truth are presented as belonging together, not competing.
* The letter warns about teaching the writer believes is harmful or untrue.
* It gives practical guidance about hospitality and boundaries.
