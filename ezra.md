# Ezra

## What this book is

Ezra tells the story of Jewish people returning to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a> after many years living in <a href="glossary.md#exile"><span title="Being forced to live away from one’s homeland.">exile</span></a> in Babylon, and trying to rebuild their community.

## What it contains

The book comes in two main parts.

### Part 1: Rebuilding the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a>

A Persian king, Cyrus, allows the Jewish people to go back to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a> and rebuild their <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a>, the main place they worshipped <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>. A leader named Zerubbabel (and the <a href="glossary.md#high-priest"><span title="The chief priest in ancient Israel’s worship system.">high priest</span></a> Jeshua) guides the first group home. They rebuild the altar first so they can restart <a href="glossary.md#sacrifice"><span title="An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).">sacrifices</span></a> and festivals, even though the city is still in ruins and they feel unsafe.

Then they begin rebuilding the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a> itself. When the foundations are laid, people react in mixed ways. Some cheer because <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> is starting again, while older people cry because they remember the old <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a> and feel the new beginning looks small.

Local opponents try to stop the project. They pressure the builders and complain to Persian officials. The work slows and then stops for a while. Later, two <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</span></a>, Haggai and Zechariah, encourage the people to keep going. Persian officials investigate, find that Cyrus really did approve the rebuilding, and the new king, Darius, orders that the work continue and even be supported. The <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">temple</span></a> is finally finished, and the people celebrate with <a href="glossary.md#sacrifice"><span title="An offering given in worship (often animals in the Old Testament).">sacrifices</span></a> and the <a href="glossary.md#passover"><span title="A Jewish festival remembering the Exodus from Egypt.">Passover</span></a> meal.

### Part 2: Ezra helps rebuild the people

Years later, another Persian king, Artaxerxes, sends Ezra to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>. Ezra is a <a href="glossary.md#priest"><span title="A religious leader in ancient Israel’s worship system.">priest</span></a> and an expert teacher of <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>’s law, meaning the teachings and rules found in the Scriptures they had at the time.

Ezra finds a serious problem. Some of the returned people, including leaders, have married people from surrounding nations and are also mixing in religious practices that Ezra believes will pull the community away from their <a href="glossary.md#faith"><span title="Trust; in Christianity, trusting God and Jesus.">faith</span></a>. Ezra prays, mourns, and calls the people to change direction. The community agrees to deal with the situation, and the book ends with a difficult reform where many families separate from those marriages.

## Big ideas

Ezra focuses on starting again after disaster, restoring <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a>, and rebuilding a community’s identity around their beliefs and shared commitments.
