# Ezra

## What this book is

Ezra tells the story of Jewish people returning to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] after many years living in exile[^gl-exile] in Babylon, and trying to rebuild their community.

## What it contains

The book comes in two main parts.

### Part 1: Rebuilding the temple[^gl-temple]

A Persian king, Cyrus, allows the Jewish people to go back to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem] and rebuild their temple[^gl-temple], the main place they worshipped God[^gl-god]. A leader named Zerubbabel (and the high priest[^gl-high-priest] Jeshua) guides the first group home. They rebuild the altar first so they can restart sacrifices and festivals, even though the city is still in ruins and they feel unsafe.

Then they begin rebuilding the temple[^gl-temple] itself. When the foundations are laid, people react in mixed ways. Some cheer because worship[^gl-worship] is starting again, while older people cry because they remember the old temple[^gl-temple] and feel the new beginning looks small.

Local opponents try to stop the project. They pressure the builders and complain to Persian officials. The work slows and then stops for a while. Later, two prophets[^gl-prophet], Haggai and Zechariah, encourage the people to keep going. Persian officials investigate, find that Cyrus really did approve the rebuilding, and the new king, Darius, orders that the work continue and even be supported. The temple[^gl-temple] is finally finished, and the people celebrate with sacrifices and the Passover[^gl-passover] meal.

### Part 2: Ezra helps rebuild the people

Years later, another Persian king, Artaxerxes, sends Ezra to Jerusalem[^gl-jerusalem]. Ezra is a priest[^gl-priest] and an expert teacher of God[^gl-god]’s law, meaning the teachings and rules found in the Scriptures they had at the time.

Ezra finds a serious problem. Some of the returned people, including leaders, have married people from surrounding nations and are also mixing in religious practices that Ezra believes will pull the community away from their faith[^gl-faith]. Ezra prays, mourns, and calls the people to change direction. The community agrees to deal with the situation, and the book ends with a difficult reform where many families separate from those marriages.

## Big ideas

Ezra focuses on starting again after disaster, restoring worship[^gl-worship], and rebuilding a community’s identity around their beliefs and shared commitments.
