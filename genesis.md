# Genesis

## What this book is

Genesis is the first book of the Christian Bible[^gl-bible]. It explains, in story form, how the world begins, why people are the way they are, and how one family becomes the start of a nation.

## What it contains

Genesis has two big parts.

### 1) The beginning of the world and humanity (Genesis 1 to 11)

* **Creation:** God[^gl-god] creates the universe, the earth, plants, animals, and humans. Humans are described as specially made to represent God[^gl-god]’s care and authority in the world.
* **Adam and Eve:** The first humans live in a garden, but they disobey God[^gl-god]. The story explains the idea that people often choose wrong even when they know better, and that this damages trust between humans and God[^gl-god], and between humans themselves.
* **Cain and Abel:** The first brothers bring offerings to God[^gl-god]. Jealousy leads Cain to kill Abel. This shows how quickly harm spreads when people let anger take over.
* **The flood and Noah:** The world becomes full of violence, and God[^gl-god] sends a flood. Noah’s family survives in an ark, and afterward God[^gl-god] makes a promise (often called a covenant[^gl-covenant], meaning a serious agreement) symbolised by a rainbow.
* **Tower of Babel:** People try to build a great tower to make a name for themselves. Languages become confused, and people spread out. This story explains human pride and why cultures and languages are diverse.

### 2) The start of God[^gl-god]’s people through a family (Genesis 12 to 50)

* **Abraham and Sarah:** God[^gl-god] calls Abraham to leave his home and promises him land, a large family, and that his family will be a blessing to others. Abraham and Sarah struggle to trust this promise, but the story shows God[^gl-god]’s patience.
* **Isaac:** Abraham’s son Isaac continues the family line.
* **Jacob (Israel[^gl-israel]) and Esau:** Isaac’s sons have conflict. Jacob later is renamed “Israel[^gl-israel],” and his children become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel[^gl-israel].
* **Joseph:** Jacob’s son Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers, but later rises to power in Egypt because he is wise and helps interpret dreams. During a famine, Joseph ends up saving his family, leading to forgiveness and reconciliation.

Genesis ends with Jacob’s family living in Egypt, setting up the story of Exodus, where their descendants later become enslaved and then freed.
