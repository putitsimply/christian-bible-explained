# Joshua

## What this book is

The book of Joshua is the story of what happens after Moses dies, when the Israelites[^gl-israel] are about to enter the land of Canaan (often called the “Promised Land” because God[^gl-god] had promised it to Abraham’s family).

## What it contains

Joshua, Moses’ helper, becomes the new leader. The people cross the Jordan River in a dramatic way. The priests[^gl-priest] carry the ark of the covenant[^gl-covenant], a sacred chest that represented God[^gl-god]’s presence with the people, and the river stops so everyone can cross. After crossing, they set up stones as a memorial.

Next comes the most famous battle, Jericho. The Israelites[^gl-israel] march around the city for several days, following specific instructions, and the city walls fall. After that, they face a setback at the town of Ai because someone disobeys God[^gl-god]’s command about keeping war goods for themselves. Once the problem is dealt with, they defeat Ai.

A key part of the book is that Joshua keeps renewing the people’s commitment to God[^gl-god]’s covenant[^gl-covenant], which means a serious promise relationship. The book shows a pattern: when the people trust and obey, things go well; when they ignore instructions, trouble follows.

Joshua also includes stories about unexpected choices and alliances. For example, a group called the Gibeonites tricks Israel[^gl-israel] into making a peace treaty with them. Israel[^gl-israel] keeps the treaty anyway, which becomes important later when other kings attack the Gibeonites and Israel[^gl-israel] goes to help them.

Large sections describe battles in the southern and northern parts of Canaan. These chapters can be confronting because they include violence. Many Christians read these stories as part of God[^gl-god]’s judgment and as the fulfillment of earlier promises, while many readers also wrestle with the moral questions the text raises.

After the fighting, the focus shifts to dividing the land among the twelve tribes. Boundaries are listed, cities are assigned, and special places are set aside, including “cities of refuge,” which were meant to provide safety and a fair process for someone accused of killing another person. Towns are also given to the Levites, the tribe responsible for religious duties.

Near the end, there is a tense moment when tribes east of the Jordan build a large altar. The other tribes worry it means rebellion, but it turns out to be a witness marker, a reminder that they still belong to the same people.

Joshua finishes with Joshua’s farewell speeches. He warns them not to copy other nations’ gods, urges them to stay faithful, and leads a final covenant[^gl-covenant] ceremony. Joshua dies, and the book closes by noting the people served God[^gl-god] during Joshua’s lifetime.
