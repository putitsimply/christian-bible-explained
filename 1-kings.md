# 1 Kings

## What this book is

**1 Kings** continues the story after King David and focuses on how Israel[^gl_israel] goes from being one united kingdom to being split in two, mainly because of leadership choices and people turning away from God[^gl_god].

## What it contains

David dies, and his son **Solomon** becomes king after some tense family and political conflict. Early on, Solomon famously asks God for **wisdom** instead of riches or power. A well known story shows his wisdom when he settles a hard case between two women arguing over a baby.

Solomon leads Israel during a time of wealth and international respect. His biggest project is building **the Temple[^gl_temple] in Jerusalem[^gl_jerusalem]**, a special place for worship[^gl_worship]. When it is finished, Solomon holds a huge dedication ceremony and prays that God will forgive and help the people when they pray there. Israel seems strong and successful, and the **Queen of Sheba** visits to see Solomon’s wisdom and the kingdom’s prosperity.

But the book also shows Solomon’s failures. He collects many wives from other nations, and he starts supporting their religions too. The story says this leads him away from worshipping God fully. Because of that, God tells Solomon that after his death the kingdom will be torn apart.

After Solomon dies, his son **Rehoboam** becomes king. The people ask for lighter taxes and less harsh labour, but Rehoboam refuses and answers aggressively. That sparks a split:

* The **northern kingdom** becomes **Israel**, led by **Jeroboam**.
* The **southern kingdom** becomes **Judah[^gl_judah]**, ruled by David’s family line in Jerusalem.
Jeroboam worries people will return to Jerusalem to worship, so he sets up rival worship centres using **golden calves**, which the book presents as a major spiritual disaster.

Later, the focus shifts to the prophet[^gl_prophet] **Elijah** during the reign of **King Ahab** in Israel. Ahab and his wife **Jezebel** promote worship of a god called **Baal**. Elijah announces a drought, survives with help from a widow, and then challenges Baal’s prophets on **Mount Carmel**. The story says God answers with fire, proving Elijah’s message, and rain finally returns. Jezebel then threatens Elijah, and he flees, discouraged, but is strengthened and sent back with new tasks.

Near the end, Ahab commits a serious injustice involving **Naboth’s vineyard**, and Elijah declares that Ahab’s family will face consequences. Ahab later dies in battle, and the book ends with Israel and Judah continuing on separate, troubled paths.

## Big ideas

* The book connects leadership choices with national wellbeing and justice.
* Worship, power, and politics are tightly linked in the story, often in unhealthy ways.
* Elijah’s stories highlight conflict between different religious loyalties and what counts as true worship.
