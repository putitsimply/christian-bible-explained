# 1 Kings

## What this book is

**1 Kings** continues the story after King David and focuses on how <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> goes from being one united kingdom to being split in two, mainly because of leadership choices and people turning away from <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a>.

## What it contains

David dies, and his son **Solomon** becomes king after some tense family and political conflict. Early on, Solomon famously asks <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> for **wisdom** instead of riches or power. A well known story shows his wisdom when he settles a hard case between two women arguing over a baby.

Solomon leads <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> during a time of wealth and international respect. His biggest project is building **the <a href="glossary.md#temple"><span title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">Temple</span></a> in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>**, a special place for <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a>. When it is finished, Solomon holds a huge dedication ceremony and prays that <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> will forgive and help the people when they pray there. <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> seems strong and successful, and the **Queen of Sheba** visits to see Solomon’s wisdom and the kingdom’s prosperity.

But the book also shows Solomon’s failures. He collects many wives from other nations, and he starts supporting their religions too. The story says this leads him away from worshipping <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> fully. Because of that, <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> tells Solomon that after his death the kingdom will be torn apart.

After Solomon dies, his son **Rehoboam** becomes king. The people ask for lighter taxes and less harsh labour, but Rehoboam refuses and answers aggressively. That sparks a split:

* The **northern kingdom** becomes **<a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>**, led by **Jeroboam**.
* The **southern kingdom** becomes **<a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a>**, ruled by David’s family line in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a>.
Jeroboam worries people will return to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem"><span title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</span></a> to <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a>, so he sets up rival <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> centres using **golden calves**, which the book presents as a major spiritual disaster.

Later, the focus shifts to the <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</span></a> **Elijah** during the reign of **King Ahab** in <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a>. Ahab and his wife **Jezebel** promote <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a> of a <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">god</span></a> called **Baal**. Elijah announces a drought, survives with help from a widow, and then challenges Baal’s <a href="glossary.md#prophet"><span title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</span></a> on **Mount Carmel**. The story says <a href="glossary.md#god"><span title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</span></a> answers with fire, proving Elijah’s message, and rain finally returns. Jezebel then threatens Elijah, and he flees, discouraged, but is strengthened and sent back with new tasks.

Near the end, Ahab commits a serious injustice involving **Naboth’s vineyard**, and Elijah declares that Ahab’s family will face consequences. Ahab later dies in battle, and the book ends with <a href="glossary.md#israel"><span title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</span></a> and <a href="glossary.md#judah"><span title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</span></a> continuing on separate, troubled paths.

## Big ideas

* The book connects leadership choices with national wellbeing and justice.
* <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">Worship</span></a>, power, and politics are tightly linked in the story, often in unhealthy ways.
* Elijah’s stories highlight conflict between different religious loyalties and what counts as true <a href="glossary.md#worship"><span title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</span></a>.
