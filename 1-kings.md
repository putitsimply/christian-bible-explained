# 1 Kings

## What this book is

**1 Kings** continues the story after King David and focuses on how <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> goes from being one united kingdom to being split in two, mainly because of leadership choices and people turning away from <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a>.

## What it contains

David dies, and his son **Solomon** becomes king after some tense family and political conflict. Early on, Solomon famously asks <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> for **wisdom** instead of riches or power. A well known story shows his wisdom when he settles a hard case between two women arguing over a baby.

Solomon leads <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> during a time of wealth and international respect. His biggest project is building **the <a href="glossary.md#temple" title="The main worship building in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.">Temple</a> in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>**, a special place for <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>. When it is finished, Solomon holds a huge dedication ceremony and prays that <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> will forgive and help the people when they pray there. <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> seems strong and successful, and the **Queen of Sheba** visits to see Solomon’s wisdom and the kingdom’s prosperity.

But the book also shows Solomon’s failures. He collects many wives from other nations, and he starts supporting their religions too. The story says this leads him away from worshipping <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> fully. Because of that, <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> tells Solomon that after his death the kingdom will be torn apart.

After Solomon dies, his son **Rehoboam** becomes king. The people ask for lighter taxes and less harsh labour, but Rehoboam refuses and answers aggressively. That sparks a split:

* The **northern kingdom** becomes **<a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>**, led by **Jeroboam**.
* The **southern kingdom** becomes **<a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a>**, ruled by David’s family line in <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a>.
Jeroboam worries people will return to <a href="glossary.md#jerusalem" title="A major city in the Bible’s story.">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a>, so he sets up rival <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> centres using **golden calves**, which the book presents as a major spiritual disaster.

Later, the focus shifts to the <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophet</a> **Elijah** during the reign of **King Ahab** in <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a>. Ahab and his wife **Jezebel** promote <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">worship</a> of a <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">god</a> called **Baal**. Elijah announces a drought, survives with help from a widow, and then challenges Baal’s <a href="glossary.md#prophet" title="A person who speaks messages they believe come from God.">prophets</a> on **Mount Carmel**. The story says <a href="glossary.md#god" title="The main divine being in Judaism and Christianity.">God</a> answers with fire, proving Elijah’s message, and rain finally returns. Jezebel then threatens Elijah, and he flees, discouraged, but is strengthened and sent back with new tasks.

Near the end, Ahab commits a serious injustice involving **Naboth’s vineyard**, and Elijah declares that Ahab’s family will face consequences. Ahab later dies in battle, and the book ends with <a href="glossary.md#israel" title="Israel can mean the people, land, or a kingdom; Israelites are the people.">Israel</a> and <a href="glossary.md#judah" title="The southern kingdom in the Old Testament; capital Jerusalem.">Judah</a> continuing on separate, troubled paths.

## Big ideas

* The book connects leadership choices with national wellbeing and justice.
* <a href="glossary.md#worship" title="Actions showing devotion to God (prayer, songs, rituals).">Worship</a>, power, and politics are tightly linked in the story, often in unhealthy ways.
