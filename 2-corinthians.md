# 2 Corinthians

## What this book is

2 Corinthians is a letter written by the [apostle](glossary.md#apostle) [^gl-apostle] Paul to the Christian community in the city of Corinth. It happens after 1 Corinthians, and it shows that Paul and the Corinthian [church](glossary.md#church) [^gl-church] have had a difficult relationship, but they are trying to repair it.

## What it contains

Paul starts by talking about suffering and comfort. He explains that he has been through many hard experiences, but he believes [God](glossary.md#god) [^gl-god] comforts people so they can comfort others. He also explains why his travel plans changed, because some people in Corinth were upset and thought he was unreliable.

A big theme in the letter is forgiveness and rebuilding trust. Paul talks about someone who caused serious trouble in the [church](glossary.md#church) (the letter does not name them). Paul encourages the [church](glossary.md#church) to forgive that person once they have shown they are truly sorry, so the person is not crushed by shame.

Paul then explains what he sees as the “new [covenant](glossary.md#covenant) [^gl-covenant],” meaning a new relationship between [God](glossary.md#god) and people through Jesus. He says this new way is not mainly about following rules written on stone, but about changed hearts and lives. He describes Christians as “ambassadors” of reconciliation, which means they are meant to help people make peace with [God](glossary.md#god) and with each other.

Paul is very honest about his weaknesses. He says following Jesus does not always look powerful or impressive. Instead, he often feels like a fragile “jar of clay,” easily cracked, but still carrying something valuable. He argues that real spiritual leadership is shown through faithfulness and love, not showy success.

Another major part of 2 Corinthians is about generosity. Paul is organising a collection of money from the churches to help poor believers in [Jerusalem](glossary.md#jerusalem) [^gl-jerusalem]. He encourages the Corinthians to give willingly, not because they are forced, and he says generous giving should be done with integrity and careful handling.

Later, Paul strongly defends his role as an [apostle](glossary.md#apostle). Some travelling teachers have been criticising him and trying to win the Corinthians over. Paul calls them “false [apostles](glossary.md#apostle)” and warns the [church](glossary.md#church) not to be tricked by impressive words. He points to his hardships, not his fame, as evidence that he is sincerely serving.

Near the end, Paul mentions a “thorn in the flesh,” a continuing problem that bothers him. He does not explain exactly what it is, but he says it taught him that [God](glossary.md#god)’s strength can be shown through human weakness.

The letter finishes with Paul urging the [church](glossary.md#church) to examine themselves, aim for peace, and live in unity.
